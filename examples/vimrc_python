" TLDR: vimrc minimum viable product for Python programming
"
" I've noticed that many vim beginners have trouble creating a useful vimrc.
" This file is intended to get a Python programmer who is new to vim
" set up with a vimrc that will enable the following:
"   1. Sane editing of Python files
"   2. Sane defaults for vim itself
"   3. An organizational skeleton that can be easily extended
"
" Notes:
"   * When in normal mode, scroll over a folded section and type 'za'
"       this toggles the folded section
"
" Initialization:
"   1. At the command line, execute the following command:
"     curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
"         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
"   2. Open vim (hint: type vim at command line and press enter :p)
"   3. :PlugInstall
"   4. :PlugUpdate
"   5. You should be ready for MVP editing
"
" Updating:
"   If you want to upgrade your vim plugins to latest version
"     :PlugUpdate
"   If you want to upgrade vim-plug itself
"     :PlugUpgrade

"A comma separated list of options for Insert mode completion
"   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
"            Useful when there is additional information about the
"            match, e.g., what file it comes from.

"   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
"            the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
"            characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
"            of completion.  For buffer text the 'ignorecase' option is
"            used.

"   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
"            completion in the preview window.  Only works in
"            combination with 'menu' or 'menuone'.
