# Ubuntu Scripts

## Manual commands

This section of the README describes useful programs you will need to install - or configure - manually, when the time is right.

### Fonts

Download relevant nerd fonts from here: <https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads>

1. Download a Nerd Font (I recommend `FiraMono Nerd Font` as of 2023-09-28).
2. Unzip and copy to `~/.local/share/fonts`. In the past, this was `~/.fonts` and `~/.fontconfig`.
3. Optionally, run the command `fc-cache -fv` to manually rebuild the font cache.
