# Ubuntu Scripts

## Manual commands

This section of the README describes useful programs you will need to install - or configure - manually, when the time is right.

### Tux Guitar

For musical tab editing

<https://github.com/helge17/tuxguitar>

### Fonts

Download a relevant font, place in `~/src/lib/fonts`, and unzip. My favorite at the moment: <https://github.com/theleagueof/league-mono>

1. Copy relevant font files to `~/.local/share/fonts`. Prefer variable fonts, and use TTF (TrueType Font data).
2. Run `fc-cache -fv`.
