# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
# env:
# TERM variable
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
# To install alacritty terminfo, run the following command from alacritty's
# root folder:
#   sudo tic -xe alacritty,alacritty-direct extra/alacritty.info
# TERM: alacritty
