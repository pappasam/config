# Default flags
# You can set up flags you want broot to start with by
# default, for example `default_flags="ihp"` if you usually want
# to see hidden and gitignored files and the permissions (then
# if you don't want the hidden files you can launch `br -H`)
# A popular flag is the `g` one which displays git related info.
