<!-- Interview Questions {{{ -->

Can you please generate a document called "INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.md" at the root of this repo that provides me a list of interview questions to ask the candidate during the interview. They'll be sharing their screen with the code running in their IDE. I'd like to ask them questions to determine whether they fully understand their code, if they can add features (e.g., can they edit software while I'm watching), modify existing functionality, update tests, and potentially work with 3rd party APIs. Also, in the document, please provide example acceptable answers. Pretend that I'm not an expert in this codebase, so as an interviewer, I'll need some hand-holding.
