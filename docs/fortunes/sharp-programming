   <dazjorz>  :)
   <rindolf>  dazjorz: yes, I are here.

   <rindolf>  dazjorz: this is about programming in general.
   <rindolf>  At least theoretically.
   <rindolf>  And VB.NET questions.

              <Zuu>  yeah, it kinda have a girlish sound to it
          <dazjorz>  rindolf: call yourself shloma, dutch people will
                     think you're over sixty and female
          <rindolf>  dazjorz: heh.
          <dazjorz>  let me rephase that
          <dazjorz>  dutch people will think you're female... and over
                     sixty
          <dazjorz>  (oma = grandma)
          <rindolf>  dazjorz: ah.
           <unreal>  kloot.
          <rindolf>  In Hebrew nouns that end with "ah" tend to be
                     feminine.
          <dazjorz>  shlomah?
          <rindolf>  Seriously now, if I change my nick it will be to
                     shlomif.
          <dazjorz>  let's change our nicks at the same time
          <rindolf>  Well, in Shlomi's case it would be Shlomith.
          <dazjorz>  I will be sjors, you will be shlomif
          <rindolf>  dazjorz: OK.
                  *  rindolf is now known as shlomif
          <dazjorz>  shit, now I have to
              <Zuu>  what does shlimif even mean ?
                  *  dazjorz is now known as sjors
            <sjors>  Zuu: shlomi = his first name, f = the first letter of
                     his last name
          <shlomif>  sjors: hi.
          <shlomif>  Zuu: shlomi fish.
            <sjors>  hi shlomif
          <shlomif>  Hi sjors
 <tommy_the-dragon>  where does rindolf come into it?
          <shlomif>  sjors: my nick is longer than yours.
              <Zuu>  oh lol, and i just said his name sound girly :P
                  *  Zuu pat pats shlomif ^^
          <shlomif>  tommy_the-dragon: Rindolf was a dwarven warrior I
                     played in AD&D.
 <tommy_the-dragon>  ahh ok
                  *  shlomif gives Zuu his tomato back.
              <Zuu>  :<
          <shlomif>  Since I'm no longer a reindeer.
            <sjors>  shlomif: that's just to compensate against something
                     you have that's way shorter than mine
          <shlomif>  sjors: LOL.
          <shlomif>  sjors++

 <tommy_the-dragon>  sorry...

              <Zuu>  Hehe
                  *  shlomif doesn't like raw tomatoes.
          <shlomif>  But I eat them with pasta, etc.
          <shlomif>  Or as meat sauce.
              <Zuu>  or in sandwiches
          <shlomif>  sjors: anyway, welcome to ##programming
              <Zuu>  or on reindeer nose
          <shlomif>  sjors: I'll probably revert to "rindolf" after next
                     disconnect.
          <shlomif>  Zuu: after you cook the entire reindeer.
                  *  shlomif is a reindeer cannibal.
          <shlomif>  Well, rindolf is.
              <Zuu>  yes, but he ran away
          <shlomif>  I also like dried and olive oiled tomatoes.
            <sjors>  shlomif: I just changed my clients' settings to
                     reconnect as sjors, too
          <shlomif>  Well, I think I'll go to sleep.
          <shlomif>  sjors: ah.
            <sjors>  shlomif: it'll probably take a while to "adapt" to
                     sjors instead of dazjorz
          <shlomif>  sjors: well, enjoy your new nick.
            <sjors>  and I still have dazjorz.com, and not sjors.anything
                  *  Zuu tugs shlomif in
            <sjors>  thanks ;)
          <shlomif>  Zuu: thanks.
                  *  Zuu quicly squeeses a fresh tomato onto shlomif's
                     nose
            <sjors>  shlomif: sjors.biz and sjors.mobi at most
                  *  shlomif doesn't have rindolf.{com,org,net} etc.
          <shlomif>  sjors: maybe sjors.in
          <shlomif>  I got a shlom.in
            <sjors>  sjors.indahou.se
          <shlomif>  sjors: heh.
            <sjors>  sjors.ac, sjors.ag, sjors.am, sjors.at
            <sjors>  hehe sjors.me
            <sjors>  sjors.pl, too bad i don't really do perl anymore
          <shlomif>  sjors: there's also .sh
            <sjors>  sjors.sh, too bad I don't really do shell script a
                     lot
          <shlomif>  Or .im
            <sjors>  sjors.tv, too bad I don't really watch..
 <tommy_the-dragon>  do you own a mobile?
          <shlomif>  .tv are pretty costly.
            <sjors>  meh I don't like sjors. anyway, so I'll just keep
                     dazjorz for everything
 <tommy_the-dragon>  yeah whats with that (the price of .tv)?
          <shlomif>  tommy_the-dragon: it's the foundation of the economy

           *  Zuu solves rindolf
   <rindolf>  Zuu: http://fc-solve.berlios.de/
   <rindolf>  Zuu: I am not solvable.
   <rindolf>  I am Turing hard.
       <Zuu>  :S
           *  Zuu never heard of anything called 'turing hard'
 <joeyadams>  lol. Zuu's probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.
       <Zuu>  but i guess i have now
 <joeyadams>  Formal definition of Turing hard: blah blah blah hard blah
              blah Turing blah.
       <Zuu>  Hahahaha :D
 <joeyadams>  Wikipedia: Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called
              Turing hard for X if X <=_T A for all X in X. If
              additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for
              X.
 <joeyadams>  Does that clarify?
 <joeyadams>  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the
              actual math symbols)
           *  joeyadams assumes you get the point
       <Zuu>  yeah, i think i'll have to put significant time into that,
              for me to comprehend it :)
       <Zuu>  but maybe i will, some day :P
 <joeyadams>  My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe
              more concise mumbo jumbo.
 <joeyadams>  E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all
              the problems in NP.
       <Zuu>  i undersstand enough of it, to be fairly confident that
              rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his
              ability to be solved
 <joeyadams>  I'm guessing Turing-hard means you can't solve a problem
              with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)
 <joeyadams>  (substitute Turing machine with "your computer" :) )
       <Zuu>  no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness
 <joeyadams>  okay, Zuu > joeyadams, so I can't help you :)
           *  Zuu tickles joeyadams ^^
 <joeyadams>  A delicious apple is any fruit ∈ apple that is at least as
              tasty as any other fruit ∈ apple.
 <joeyadams>  In other words, apples are in the set of recursively
              nommable fruits.
   <rindolf>  joeyadams: what's up?
 <joeyadams>  I'm babbling.
   <rindolf>  joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.
           *  Zuu watches a number of apples that recursively NOM's
              eathother
   <rindolf>  It tends to be too commonplace.
   <rindolf>  Or simpleton.
 <joeyadams>  whoops, my logic is incorrect
 <joeyadams>  Only delicious apples are ∈ the nommable fruits.
 <joeyadams>  (recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)
           *  Zuu NOMs joeyadams :>
   <rindolf>  joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is
              his favourite fruit.
   <rindolf>  Ta-zuu!
           *  joeyadams has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by
              peer))
       <Zuu>  yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of
              words to sound smart :/
       <Zuu>  my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!
 <joeyadams>  although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to
              solve complex problems. As Aristophanes said, "High thoughts
              must have high language."
       <Zuu>  .. along with immutable polymorphic pears
 <joeyadams>  Zuu> I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?
 <joeyadams>  lol
       <Zuu>  Hahah, yeah :P
 <joeyadams>  I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.
       <Zuu>  i eat them in linear time, but uses exponential space

     <Zuu>  i think you have forgottoen to define the #intro anchor
 <rindolf>  Zuu: reload.
 <rindolf>  Zuu: it's there.
     <Zuu>  hah, caches... :P
     <Zuu>  :D
 <rindolf>  Pesky things.
 <rindolf>  Evil reindeers don't like caches.
 <rindolf>  Neither do cats.
 <rindolf>  I'm an evil reindeer but a good cat.
     <Zuu>  Hehe
 <rindolf>  Don't know how it works.
 <rindolf>  I guess good and evil are relative.

      <Zuu>  Hi rindolf :)
  <rindolf>  Hi Zuu
  <rindolf>  Zuu: I've been thinking that maybe you can find some
             corresponding Zuus of the appropriate sex in a different
             dimension.
      <Zuu>  hmmm... interresting!
  <rindolf>  Zuu: are you a heterosexual Zuu or a homosexual one?
      <Zuu>  Im not sure what sex I am.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah.
      <Zuu>  :P
  <rindolf>  Zuu: you can look.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: in the mirror or something.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: don't you have obligatory genders in Danish/
  <rindolf>  ?
  <rindolf>  Like in German, French, etc.
  <rindolf>  Or Hebrew and Arabic.
      <Zuu>  obligatory genders?
      <Zuu>  you mean, the genders in linguistics?
          *  Zuu never understood those
      <Zuu>  but Danish have two i believe, and if i remember correctly
             there is female and 'none'
  <rindolf>  Zuu: yes, genders in linguistics.
      <Zuu>  i dont remember what which is which though :P
  <rindolf>  Like in Hebrew "Haben Halakh lagan" - the boy went to the
             garden. "Habath Halkha lagan" - "The girl went to the garden"
 <c_sphere>  That almost sounds like allah akbar
      <Zuu>  rindolf, no we dont distinct between the genders of the
             subject in the danish language
      <Zuu>  our nouns have genders though
 <c_sphere>  zuu-nina?
      <Zuu>  like 'house' is one gender and 'car' is another
  <rindolf>  Zuu: of course the question is - what language do Zuus speak
             natively?
 <c_sphere>  rindolf: Of course, Zuu speaks Zuu!
  <rindolf>  Zuuish?
 <c_sphere>  The Zulu population also does not speak Zuluish, just Zulu.
      <Zuu>  so if you want to say 'the house' its 'huse_t_' and if you
             want to say 'the car' its 'bile_n_'
  <rindolf>  c_sphere: Arnavoth (sounds like an Aztec god) is "Hares" (the
             Rabbit-like mammal) in Hebrew.
  <rindolf>  Zuu: can you understand Swedish?
 <c_sphere>  Aemeth
      <Zuu>  rindolf, some :)
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah.
      <Zuu>  swedish branched from danish afaik
      <Zuu>  same with norwegian
      <Zuu>  yes, Zuu's speak Zuuish nativley :P
          *  rindolf is listening to Hans Zimmer - Jack Sparrow
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah.
      <Zuu>  Zuuish have few words, all of which is based on words about
             cake from othre languages :P
      <Zuu>  c_sphere, are you by any chance related to s_cube ?
  <rindolf>  Zuu: ah, what do you use the Hebrew word "עוגיה" (= `ugiyah,
             cookie) for?
  <rindolf>  "Chocolate chip pie crust marmalade marzipan cookie yum yum!"
      <Zuu>  i use it for cookies baked from a hebrew recipe :P
  <rindolf>  What does it mean in Zuuish?
      <Zuu>  it's hard to really say something in Zuuish... al you can
             really do is say something equivalent to "COOKIES!!"
      <Zuu>  or "YAY CAKE!"
      <Zuu>  basically, you can only express excitement over different
             kinds of cakes :P
  <rindolf>  Zuu: do Zuus eat anything except cakes or cookies?
      <Zuu>  There was this one time...
      <Zuu>  wait.. no. That was someone else.

  <rindolf>  Chekov: I disagere with what ESR says in TAOUP that you
             shouldn't apply factor optimisations. I think they can make a
             very large difference.
  <rindolf>  Chekov: he seems to imply you should wait until computers are
             fast enough.
  <rindolf>  Problem is people don't want to upgrade and if a competing
             program (maybe a fork ) is much faster, then some of them
             will switch.
  <rindolf>  Programs being speedy is one thing that makes me happy.

  <rindolf>  And I enjoy the fact that Pidgin is much faster than Kopete
             (and also less buggy).
  <rindolf>  I've used Kopete for far too long.
  <osoleve>  rindolf: switch to Irssi and Bitlbee! :D
  <rindolf>  vanguard: yes.
  <rindolf>  vanguard: though they failed on Google Wave.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: nah, I like Pidgin.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: it's fast enough for me.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: and I also prefer XChat.
  <osoleve>  but is it nerdy enough?
  <rindolf>  osoleve: I'm not trying to be a Ubergeek.
  <rindolf>  osoleve: real men use Xmonad!
 <vanguard>  Hey, it is not Uber but Über ... :D
  <rindolf>  real programmers use butterflies.

        <wes_>  tell me how can u print a message without using a

     <rindolf>  wes_: in C?
     <rindolf>  wes_: do you mean the printf(...) statement?
        <wes_>  yes
     <rindolf>  wes_: you cannot without using macros I think.
     <rindolf>  wes_: and don't use macros for that.
        <wes_>  i mean without using a semicolon at the printf statement
                but you have to use printf only

     <rindolf>  amigojapan: that's not fair trade.
     <rindolf>  But I'll treasure the whitespace.
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: a whitespace is just as valuable as a semicolon
                in python :)
     <rindolf>  amigojapan: aren't semicolons optional in Py?
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: I think they are
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: actually, a whitespace can be as valuable as 2
                curly braces :)
     <rindolf>  amigojapan: heh.
     <rindolf>  amigojapan: you need 4 spaces to distinguish stuff
                properly.
  <amigojapan>  rindolf: one thing I never got about python is why they

  <amigojapan>  rindolf: the fact that you dont have a rule to how much

     <rindolf>  marzy: Emacs is not a better vim. They are very different.
     <rindolf>  marzy: I could never get used to Emacs, but have used Vim
                for many years.
       <marzy>  rindolf Emacs + Evil mode makes a better vim
     <rindolf>  marzy: does it support all Vim extensions?
       <marzy>  no, that's why its better. it doesn't come with retarded
                scripting language!!
     <rindolf>  marzy: well, it's still not 100% compatible with vim.
     <rindolf>  marzy: and Evil is an awful name. Sorry.
     <rindolf>  "The only thing more evil than XSLT is XSLT edited with
                Emacs Evil mode." ;-)
       <marzy>  i think it's a good name considering emacs and vi(m)
                rivalry
     <rindolf>  marzy: of course, I've heard worse - coq and coccinelle.
     <rindolf>  And then there's this guy here who called his programming
                language Flua which reminds me of Flu and Influenza.
 <Reactionary>  rindolf: lol
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, flua IDE is not that bad to be fair (at least the
                little i tried )
     <rindolf>  dardevelin: didn't say *it* was bad - I said the name was
                bad.
     <rindolf>  dardevelin: and I could never get it running here.
                Problems with Py3 and PyQt.
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, oh that sucks... :/
     <rindolf>  dardevelin: yes.
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, yeah i know you didn't said it was bad, just as
                gave you my opinion on it as a side note. sorry i should
                have made it more explicit :)
     <rindolf>  Of course, Evil is not as bad a name as SLIME, which is
                another Emacs mode.
  <dardevelin>  rindolf, i had troubles with SLIME once and boy i got
                tired of fighting with it
     <rindolf>  Reportedly it was also the nickname of an internal
                Microsoft version control system called SLM (that is now
                largely discontinued).

 <codescience>  just stumbled across another question. is there an
                open-source license that prevent anyone from making money
                off my code?
     <rindolf>  codescience: no there isn't.
     <rindolf>  codescience: it stands against the open source definition.
        <ssta>  codescience: that would violate the spirit of what most
                people understand "open source" to mean
     <rindolf>  codescience: people can sell copies of open source
                software or services related to it.
 <codescience>  hmmm, i understand
     <rindolf>  codescience: see
                http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html
        <ssta>  I can legally sell you this copy of the linux kernel...I
                can charge whaqtever you are willing to pay. Nothing in
                the license prevents this
     <rindolf>  ssta: will you sell it to me for 5,000 USD?
     <rindolf>  ;-)
        <ssta>  rindolf: sure
     <rindolf>  ssta: how about for 3,000 USD?
        <ssta>  rindolf: tell you what, for $10,000 I'll throw in a free
                copy of FreeBSD
     <rindolf>  ssta: wow, sounds like a good deal.
        <ssta>  rindolf: hmm, 3000 is a bit low, I don't think I could go
                that cheap
     <rindolf>  ssta: heh.
     <rindolf>  ssta: how much are you selling the source code of Apache
                2.4 for?
        <ssta>  rindolf: oh, you can have that for free
     <rindolf>  ssta: really?
     <rindolf>  Sucker!
        <ssta>  rindolf: sure...but the build scripts you have to pay for
     <rindolf>  ssta: OK.
     <rindolf>  ssta: would you be willing to exchange the source of the
                Linux kernel for three copies of jQuery? I will even throw
                in a few free Dojo plugins.
     <rindolf>  ssta: he already told us.
        <ssta>  rindolf: hmm, not sure I want jQuery
        <ssta>  rindolf: would you happen to have code for a halfway
                decent RDBMS? I think I could swap for that
     <rindolf>  ssta: I have the source code for MySQL. Not sure if it's
                half-decent.
 <codescience>  i run a mysql server. runs good enough for me
        <ssta>  rindolf: I use MySQL in production quite a lot. It has its
                flaws, but my use cases never seem to hit them
     <rindolf>  ssta: OK.
     <rindolf>  ssta: so will you exchanges its source code for the Linux
                kernel?
        <ssta>  rindolf: sure
     <rindolf>  ssta: sounds good.
     <rindolf>  ssta: you can find the source code of MySQL here -
                http://www.mysql.com/
        <ssta>  rindolf: you can get the linux source from kernel.org
     <rindolf>  ssta: thanks.

 <doomrobo>  rindolf, I got redirected to your gcc important flags page
             today and I think you may be missing a few things
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: do you mean the one in the talk?
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: which page are you referring to?
 <doomrobo>  rindolf, lemme see
  <rindolf>  http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/W2L/Development/slides/gcc/flags.html
             - heh, first Google hit for "gcc important flags"
  <rindolf>  At least for me.
 <doomrobo>  yeah
  <rindolf>  doomrobo: OK, I did not originate that page originally.

     <tnzr>  does anyone happen to know what std::allocator.allocate()
             does when you try to allocate 0 bytes? I get a pointer back
             but I can't tell what it's pointing at and I can't seem to
             find anything on the web that gives a difinitive answer
   <GeDaMo>  Why are you allocating zero bytes?
 <Billiard>  tnzr: the same thing it always returns
     <tnzr>  GeDaMo: we are implementing our own allocator for an
             assignment, and when asked what we should do if the user
             tries to allocate 0 bytes, the prof said to find out what
             std::allocator does and mimic that
   <GeDaMo>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6065814/standard-compliant-custom-allocator
     <tnzr>  oh snap, thanks GeDaMo
   <GeDaMo>  :)
  <rindolf>  GeDaMo: zero bytes are enough to hold the Complete Works of
             Shakespeare.
   <GeDaMo>  Depends on how many monkeys you have to decompress it :P
  <rindolf>  GeDaMo: heh.
  <rindolf>  Of course, I defined a custom decompressor that emits the
             complete works of Shakespeare on empty input and uses gzip
             compression otherwise.
  <rindolf>  It's pretty large though.
 <Billiard>  redeemed: compress the decompressor using the same algo
 <Billiard>  errr rindolf
  <rindolf>  Billiard: OK.
  <rindolf>  Billiard: heh.
 <Billiard>  0 bytes = a decompressor for the entire works of shakespeare

      <cheeseduck>  rindolf: How long have you got on the book?
            <Jude>  rindolf, did you check out the new game of thrones
                    episode?
         <rindolf>  Jude: no, I don't watch Game of Thrones.
         <rindolf>  Jude: I did see this on Slashdot -
                    http://yro.slashdot.org/story/13/03/31/1347248/hbo-says-game-of-thrones-piracy-is-a-compliment
                    .
         <rindolf>  Jude: quite encouraging.
            <Jude>  why
         <rindolf>  Jude: what is encouraging?
         <rindolf>  Jude: I mean that some television producers are having
                    a clue about piracy.
         <rindolf>  Jude: I think the MPAA is likely going to follow the
                    lead of the RIAA and endorse the Internet.
         <rindolf>  Jude: well, there's still a long way to go with even

      <cheeseduck>  rindolf: "How to win friends and..."
         <rindolf>  cheeseduck: ah, that. MAking slow progress in it.
         <rindolf>  cheeseduck: I thought it was a book *I* was writing.
         <rindolf>  Lately, I've been writing books and screenplays and
                    stuff more than I've been reading them. :-D
      <cheeseduck>  "I've been reading a lot of scripts lately." "You

                    they are.
         <rindolf>  cheeseduck: they have good imagination.
      <cheeseduck>  I always found the standard they are supposed to be

         <rindolf>  Jude: I prefer humour or drama/humour or sci-fi/humour
                    or sci-fi/humour/drama or stuff like that.
            <Jude>  k, sorry to have bothered you

                    Friendship Is Magic, and so far - I'm game.
         <rindolf>  Jude: you did not bother me.
            <Jude>  never seen it
         <rindolf>  Jude: do you watch My Little Pony?
         <rindolf>  Jude: ah, I love it so far.
            <Jude>  heard it can get quite rough
            <Jude>  more nudity and violence than spartacus and game of
                    thrones combined
         <rindolf>  One episode involved a lot of songs, which I disliked.
         <rindolf>  Jude: heh, LOL.
         <rindolf>  Jude++
         <rindolf>  Jude: it's directed at little girls.
         <rindolf>  Jude: so it's a pretty clean show.
            <Jude>  yeah I know
            <Jude>  I was kidding
         <rindolf>  Jude: if you want incest and violence, then look no
                    further than the Jewish bible.
            <Jude>  there are a lot of dubbing sections of the show to go

            <Jude>  rindolf, I'm jewish
         <rindolf>  Jude: reportedly, it was quite realism then (the Bible
                    I mean).
         <rindolf>  Jude: ah, nice. So am I.
            <Jude>  and I couldn't agree more
            <Jude>  I have to go watch game of thrones
         <rindolf>  Jude: yes, you need to process the Bible a lot to get

            <Jude>  will talk to you in an hour
         <rindolf>  Jude: enjoy.

                    clothing.
         <rindolf>  Like valid HTML, modern CSS, some JS enhancements,
                    etc.
         <rindolf>  But still static HTML pages.
         <rindolf>  I have some blogs on livejournal.com/etc.
            <Jude>  do you know a guy called nimrod?
         <rindolf>  Jude: there are many people called Nimrod - it's a
                    common name.
            <Jude>  don't want to give him in on public chat
         <rindolf>  Jude: not sure I know a Nimrod off hand.
            <Jude>  nevermind then
         <rindolf>  Jude: OK, feel free to PM.
         <rindolf>  Jude: many Israeli names can get confusing.
         <rindolf>  OK.
         <rindolf>  Jude: I can easily come to Rabin sq. - there's a bus
                    there from here.
            <Jude>  he's my brother, he lives close to you and he's also
                    an open-source enthusaist
            <Jude>  I know
            <Jude>  there are plenty of them
         <rindolf>  Jude: ah, that's great.
            <Jude>  I take them to uni on a daily basis
            <Jude>  I live right by rabin sq.
         <rindolf>  Jude: so you study in TAU?
            <Jude>  yeah
         <rindolf>  Jude: TAU has tons of hot chicks.
            <Jude>  there are some
         <rindolf>  Jude: there aren't a lot of people on the streets of
                    Gimmel.
         <rindolf>  Jude: so you study CS?
            <Jude>  no way
            <Jude>  maths
         <rindolf>  Jude: ah, I see.
         <rindolf>  Jude: maths...
            <Jude>  I know one or two nice looking girls, but I usually
                    get put off by their personalities
         <rindolf>  Jude: I think maths is taught wrong in several
                    aspects.
         <rindolf>  Jude: ah.
            <Jude>  I've only been attracted to one specimen of the female
                    sex ever
            <Jude>  in my entire life
         <rindolf>  Jude: ah, really?
            <Jude>  I dunno, I agree when you speak of highschool maths
            <Jude>  I like university maths so far
            <Jude>  my professors are really nice
         <rindolf>  Jude: well, there are a lot of girls studying more
                    humane stuff.
         <rindolf>  Jude:
                    http://blogs.perl.org/users/shlomi_fish/2013/03/ann-my-transition-from-software-developer-to-writerentertaineramateur-philosopherinternet-celebrity.html
            <Jude>  I generally don't like people who study humane
                    subjects (I don't consider philosophy to be as such
                    though)
         <rindolf>  Jude: I've made a transition from a mathematician to a
                    software developer and now I'm more of a
                    writer/entertainer/amateur-philosopher.
            <Jude>  you didn't like the way it was taught?
         <rindolf>  Jude: like which way?
         <rindolf>  Jude: you mean maths?
            <Jude>  yes
         <rindolf>  Jude: well: 1. No pairwise work. Big mistake.
         <rindolf>  2. Need to memorise a lot of silly stuff. Why??
         <rindolf>  3. Maybe allow some sloppiness. Make maths more
                    humane.
            <Jude>  that's why you got philosophy
            <Jude>  maths can't afford to be sloppy
         <rindolf>  There's something poetical about many maths' proofs.
            <Jude>  the intuitive ideas behind them
            <Jude>  are beautiful
            <Jude>  but intuition can be misleading
            <Jude>  that's why you have to be really strict
         <rindolf>  Jude: yes, that's why I think we should now move into
                    proof verifier realm.
            <Jude>  if you want your proof to be valid
         <rindolf>  Jude: right.
         <rindolf>  Jude: but I was once criticised for this -
                    http://ladypine.livejournal.com/24574.html
         <rindolf>  Jude: thing is - not everything should be strict when
                    teaching.
         <rindolf>  Jude: I agree that mathematical intuition can be
                    misleading, but it's still a good thing to have.
         <rindolf>  Jude: thing is I think many mathematicians now require
                    a lot of dedication and selling their soul to the
                    devil, which is turning them into
                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Nemo -s.
            <Jude>  it's not a very formal proof
         <rindolf>  Jude: when I studied EE most of my courses were with
                    open material, and I could do pairwise work, which I
                    enjoyed.
            <Jude>  but seems to hold
         <rindolf>  Jude: yes.
            <Jude>  I guess you are right
         <rindolf>  Jude: :-D
            <Jude>  that the concept is more important than the
                    formalization
            <Jude>  but a lot of my professors agree with you
            <Jude>  and would give much more attention to grasping the
                    important concept, and understanding intuition behind
                    proofs
         <rindolf>  Jude: I'm always right. Unless I claim that "A is
                    not-A". But Chuck Norris would be right even then.
            <Jude>  lol
         <rindolf>  Hah! A new Chuck Norris factoid.
            <Jude>  <3
            <Jude>  it's been nice chatting with you, I really have to go
                    now, I need to watch GoT and then go to bed and wake
                    up in 4 hours
         <rindolf>  Jude: my father and I now have an ongoing Chuck Norris
                    meme.
         <rindolf>  Jude: bye, have fun, and good night.
            <Jude>  rindolf, what's that
         <rindolf>  Jude: what?
            <Jude>  the Chuck Norris meme
         <rindolf>  Jude: well, we say stuff like "you're my most Chuck
                    Norris dad." or "I taught Chuck Norris how to fight."
         <rindolf>  It's a personal running joke.
         <rindolf>  Well, a family-wide one.
         <rindolf>  We have our own jargon.
            <Jude>  heh
         <rindolf>  Most families do.
            <Jude>  I'm not close enough to any member of my family
            <Jude>  to do that
         <rindolf>  Ah.
            <Jude>  talk to you later, ciao
         <rindolf>  Bye.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  rindolf: Douglas Hofstadter gave a talk about how
                    mathematicians aren't as rigorous as they claim to be
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  and that they use a lot of analogical thinking
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: ah, OK.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  it was at the university of Toronto
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  I missed it sadly though
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: ah.
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: was it filmed?
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  but I can basically tell you what he said more or less
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  rindolf: there was a webcast
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: OK.
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: ah.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  not sure if it can be accessed still
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: ah.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  <+Nisstyre-laptop> but if you read either GEB or I Am
                    a Strange Loop you'll get it
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: I read GEB.
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: GEB was a nice book, but I knew a lot
                    of what he was saying there.
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: I still enjoyed the drama stuff in
                    the middle with Achilles, the Tortoise and their
                    friends.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  rindolf: you had the idea of using PM as a metaphor
                    for systems of thinking and the mind?
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  because that's what the book is about
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: PM?
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  principia mathematica
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  the formal system constructed by Russell and Whitehead
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: I didn't think of it.
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: yes, I know.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  the entire book is his theory of consciousness
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  and how there are levels of thinking
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: well, I read "I think, therefore I
                    laugh" before I read GEB.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  you can be less of a thinking being, etc...
         <rindolf>  Yes, he says that consciousness requires thinking in
                    loops, or self-reflection.
         <rindolf>  Well, it's an informal theory of consciousness.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  it requires what he calls a strange loop
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  and there can be many levels to it
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  more levels == what we think of as more human or more
                    conscious beings
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  so PM actually is able to self reflect to an extent
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  although it requires a human to interpret it
         <rindolf>  I believe, that creating artificial
                    intelligence/artificial consciousness won't be easy to
                    do, will require a lot of complex code, and will
                    likely be faulty (have its own will, make mistakes,
                    not run as quickly as more specialised code, etc.).
         <rindolf>  Nisstyre-laptop: yes.
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  depends what you mean by AI
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  there are several different definitions
           <gde33>  the first human like robot will be build in japan, the
                    first artifical intelligence in the us
        <doomlord>  heh
           <gde33>  hahaha
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  the church-turing hypothesis would seem to imply it's
                    possible, at least in principle
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  to create "strong" AI
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  although I intensely dislike that term
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  since it tries to say that any system of thinking that
                    doesn't work exactly the same as a human one isn't AI
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  which is BS
           <gde33>  you guys are all worried about intelligence, I think
                    that will be the easy part. Then comes the important
                    stuff: giving it a sense of humor.
        <doomlord>  so there was the idea that consciousness is associated
                    with information flow, and that "more" information
                    flow is "More" consciousness, a continuum like
                    gravity... but gravity can produce a qualitatively
                    different effect past a certain level (black holes..)
        <doomlord>  so the "loop" is where information flow becomes
                    qualitatively different ?
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  doomlord: have you read GEB?
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  it would be the ability a system has to observe
                    itself, and encode the system itself in the system
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  in otherwords self reflection
           <gde33>  I don't know many people who can be truly accused of
                    having their own thoughts
        <doomlord>  i dont thinkso but i have some related quotes from
                    somewhere
        <doomlord>  but can a system only approximate itself
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  principia mathematica has that ability
        <doomlord>  can a computer emulate itself...
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  as Goedel showed
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  you can encode formulas in PM as formulas in PM
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  doomlord: yes
        <doomlord>  but to what practical extent
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  what is that supposed to mean?
        <doomlord>  nature has many 'feedback loops' involving information
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  physical limitations result in a hard limit of
                    feedback loops
        <doomlord>  whats GEB, links?
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  if you point a camera at a mirror eventually it will
                    "stop"
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  doomlord: it's a book
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  Godel, Escher, Bach
        <doomlord>  ah google reveals
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  but the sequel is more clear on what it's about
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  I Am A Strange Loop
        <doomlord>  ok sounds interestign
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  doomlord: anyway, if you nest implementations of a
                    computer in a computer eventually there will be a
                    limit imposed by the physical situation
 <Nisstyre-laptop>  i.e. the memory and processor speed
           <gde33>  only for limited thinkers
           <gde33>  it's like entropy, only for people who are afraid to
                    think :P
        <doomlord>  but dont physical systems also have practical
                    limitations
           <gde33>  yes but those are not what we imagine them to be
           <gde33>  if only we knew the meaning of life, that would make
                    things so much easier
        <Stryyker>  how?
         <rindolf>  I think the whole "AIs spawning AIs" dream is not a
                    good strategy for doing software dev. I think
                    programming is here to stay. It's not like humans can
                    efficiently do what a dedicated polynomial time
                    program can.
        <doomlord>  even humans get programmed, lol
         <rindolf>  doomlord: yes.
           <gde33>  that new immortality project had some interesting
                    videos
         <rindolf>  doomlord: a large part of human technology is mental.
         <rindolf>  doomlord: in fact, we can no longer survive without
                    our mental technology. We couldn't for thousands of
                    years.
           <gde33>  oh but we can
           <gde33>  just need a favorable environment
        <doomlord>  cultural template = human OS
           <gde33>  not mine
         <rindolf>  gde33: you can survive without your mental technology?
                    Even without conceptual thought?
           <gde33>  not sure what you mean
           <gde33>  isn't that what all the other species do?
        <doomlord>  i saw some TED talk trying to explain the difference
                    between chinese and western spending/saving habits in
                    the way the language encourages people to think about
                    time
        <doomlord>  supposedly chinese language makes it harder to think
                    of past,present,future seperately
           <gde33>  languages can be really weird
           <gde33>  all languages have the word "argument" but some want
                    it to have aditional meanings, I believe in china an
                    argument is equal to disobedience. lol
      <Belxjander>  huh?
           <gde33>  in english it is a kind of fight
           <gde33>  争 is a dispute 争论 is an argument or debate
           <gde33>  I cant think of good examples, I used to know a girl
                    who knew many languages
           <gde33>  she showed me how some things are badly broken in some
                    languages
        <doomlord>  is it true japanese can't say "no", they have to
                    repeat the question in negative..
        <doomlord>  thats what we were told when learning but they must
                    have a word for no surely
      <Belxjander>  doomlord: there is "Hai" for Yes and "iie" for no
        <doomlord>  so its just impolite to say "no" i guess
                 *  Belxjander is living in Japan
      <Belxjander>  doomlord: you lose context...
      <Belxjander>  doomlord: in English you don't repeat
           <gde33>  hah no
      <Belxjander>  but in Japanese you do
      <Belxjander>  gde33: depends on the person... my mother and father
                    thought nothing of explaining politeness to me and
                    will happilly talk overtop me when I am speaking
         <rindolf>  gde33: I only know (Modern) Hebrew, English, some
                    mostly forgotten Written Arabic, and some French
                    (which I'm now trying to regain).
      <Belxjander>  I have also run into the same from Chinese, Japanese,
                    American, European AND African people I have met
         <rindolf>  gde33: well, I also know bits of other languages like
                    Spanish, Russian, German, etc.
         <rindolf>  gde33: I know that in Hebrew we have compulsive
                    genders for objects, so we don't care about phrasing
                    sentences in a gender-neutral form, which is an
                    English obsession.
         <rindolf>  gde33: I think it is parodied in this book -
                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Legs_and_All_%28novel%29
                    (great one, BTW - taught me a lot).
        <doomlord>  heh languages with sexism built in.. gender all the
                    way through
           <gde33>  some languages are also more emotional than others
           <gde33>  italians are hilarious
           <gde33>  so much enthusiasm it makes you think something is
                    going on
      <Belxjander>  gde33: spoken or written and the correct manner for if
                    you are addressing "up/peer/down" the social ladder
                    with regards respect... yes
           <gde33>  Belxjander: does that apply to many words?

 <cousteau>  damn printer... it's made like 4 fubared copies
 <cousteau>  jamming all the time, having to remove an accordion-shaped
             paper each time
 <cousteau>  turns out there was another sheet jammed, but it was hidden
             and the printer wasn't detecting it
    <pulse>  i wonder if printers will still jam paper in the year 3000
    <pulse>  maybe it's a paradox of physics
    <pulse>  a fluke in nature
     <`Gin>  I think its more down to the fact printer companies have been
             milking their cash cow dry, £10 in R&D each year. etc.
    <pulse>  maybe some day paper will become obsolete, then there will be
             no problem anymore
     <`Gin>  There are still employees at my job who would prefer to print
             an email out, read it and then reply to the email.
     <`Gin>  I don't have much hope for that dream pulse :P
    <pulse>  that's just stupid :P
 <cousteau>  pulse, how in the hell would printers work BETTER in the
             future?
 <cousteau>  the more intelligent they become, the more stupid things
             they'll do!
 <cousteau>  the machine rebellion will start with printers, it's a known
             fact
 <koollman>  I suppose the equivalent of paper jam with a 3d printer can
             get really messy
 <cousteau>  heh
 <koollman>  "we cannot access the printer, it is inside a large blob of
             solidified plastic"
 <koollman>  "the first maintenance team went in, but that was 2 days ago,
             and we are preparing a rescue mission"

 <cousteau>  koollman, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo
 <koollman>  cousteau: yes, but that one would auto-reproduce, which is
             much more scary ;)
 <koollman>  although I guess a very advanced printer could print itself,
             it's the goal of reprap-like systems
    <pulse>  nothing a giant emp wave wouldn't fix
  <rindolf>  koollman: heh.
 <cousteau>  maybe the 3D printer accidentally gets programmed with
             printing a 3D copy of itself, and that copy turns out to be
             already programmed with the same program
    <pulse>  haha
 <cousteau>  3D printer fork bomb!
 <koollman>  :)
  <rindolf>  Heh.
 <keepsake>  Ah, replicators.
          *  koollman remembers actually using a postscript 'bomb'
 <cousteau>  ...as an unrelated note, the :(){... forkbomb doesn't work on
             the `dash` interpreter
 <cousteau>  it says that : is not a valid function name
 <cousteau>  so you can fool your friends by trying to convince them that
             the forkbomb doesn't work
 <koollman>  cousteau: that's not to hard to modify, although the result
             will be less obscure. or is it that it doesn't support
             recursion ?
 <cousteau>  koollman, replace : with F and you have a working one
 <koollman>  ok, so just the character is forbidden as a name. a bit sad
 <cousteau>  or with _
 <koollman>  _ works, it's still quite hard to read :)
 <cousteau>  with _, if you tilt your head, it looks like a toilet on top
             of a tree
    <pulse>  that's some vivid imagination
  <wei2912>  lol
 <cousteau>  or a chair or something
 <koollman>  pulse: shell programming may have unexpected side-effets ;)
    <pulse>  like waking up in a mental asylum
    <pulse>  ? :)
 <koollman>  nah. But I do remember making very bad jokes about zombie
             processes, reapers and clones
    <pulse>  hmm
 <koollman>  I woke up as a sysadmin, too. that may partially qualify
    <pulse>  lol

     <rindolf>  ashmew2: ah, that's OK. :-)
     <ashmew2>  rindolf, just fixed issues that cropped up with a new

     <ashmew2>  Let's hope that's not an infinite loop.

     <rindolf>  ashmew2: run it in a background process/thread.
     <ashmew2>  hahaha
     <rindolf>  ashmew2: :-)
     <ashmew2>  not necessarily infinite, we don't know how the variable
                forgiven is modified by the called function :P :P
     <rindolf>  ashmew2: well, this is pseudocode.
 <RangerMauve>  ashmew2: It could be potentially infinite if I die
     <ashmew2>  RangerMauve, don't let the requests be pending then :D
     <ashmew2>  for the sake of infinite rise in universal entropy.
 <RangerMauve>  Maybe I want it to happen. Manye I'm some sort of
                existential anarchist
     <ashmew2>  well, Anarchy, no matter how inviting, doesn't really lead
                to fruitful consequences. But i guess that's
                individualistic at best.

 <rindolf>  Oh, God, FizzBuzz discussion.
  <Rounin>  rindolf: Which framework do you think is best for FizzBuzz?
            I'm thinking Spring, Hibernate and Struts, with jQuery for the
            user-facing parts, of course
  <Rounin>  To properly print the lines, you see
  <Rounin>  Also FizzBuzz in C# is hopelessly out of date
         *  Rounin ducks and grabs popcorn
    <adsc>  fizzbuzz can be a challenging exercise if you require an
            exotic language like Chef
    <adsc>  you know what would be cool? A language that has an
            implementation for all such trivial programming exercises in
            the standard lib. Just imagine how confused a noob programmer
            would be when he couldn't just fizzBuzz() in standard C to
            solve the exercise...
  <Rounin>  :P
  <Rounin>  atoi is a nice exercise though

   <rindolf>  olamachon: sorry, I meant that it's great that svn.php.net

 <olamachon>  rindolf: Hopefully I'll get like a 10 sec clip in some svn
              documentary on the history channel
 <XMPPwocky>  rindolf: you *know* that the people working on svn.php had
              to have an offline backup
   <rindolf>  olamachon: I like your title too.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: "And it went down, and that is how I knew it was
              the beginning of the end"
   <rindolf>  olamachon: heh.

   <rindolf>  olamachon: “I remembered the happy days when I was using the

              actually wrote some novellas and screenplay-of-sorts here.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: right right, novellas. I was thinking more like I
              was the glue guy in a documentary
 <olamachon>  rindolf: So I was trying to be super cliche
   <rindolf>  olamachon: ah.
   <rindolf>  olamachon: so was I.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: I like the ironic cliche where it actually means
              nothing
 <olamachon>  rindolf: its just all good sounding filler
   <rindolf>  “I looked at the clock on my desktop. Each seconds seemed
              like a century. What will I do without the svn server

              asking all these questions?”
   <rindolf>  olamachon: I wonder where I first read cliches such as that.
              Maybe it was someone parodying them.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: "Then I had an existential epiphany. What is SVN?
              What am I? What are we doing in this universe? This foray
              into the metaphysical was cut short by a brief glance at the

   <rindolf>  olamachon: ah, I see.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: is it that obvious? haha
   <rindolf>  olamachon: you may be a natural.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: I wrote like an essay or two in university, they

   <rindolf>  olamachon: ah, so little?
 <olamachon>  rindolf: I read a copious amount of literature
   <rindolf>  olamachon: ah, OK.
   <rindolf>  olamachon: OK, I'll keep this conversation.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: Perhaps that has a prolific effect on my penchant
              for the perverse verbosity?
   <rindolf>  olamachon: and put it on that page.
   <rindolf>  olamachon: yes, maybe.
 <olamachon>  rindolf: Sure. I feel like we may be getting a bit off-topic
              here
   <rindolf>  olamachon: yes, well, svn.php.net is back - that's what
              important.
   <rindolf>  Seize the svn.
   <rindolf>  Carpe svn!
 <olamachon>  rindolf: Nice. I see what you did there. I am literally
              doing that as fast as I can
   <rindolf>  Well, not sure the Latin is right.
 <olamachon>  carpe is the seize part
   <rindolf>  "Occupy svn.php.net!"
 <olamachon>  diem is day
   <rindolf>  olamachon: yes, I know.
   <rindolf>  But maybe svn has to be conjugated.
 <olamachon>  oh was carpe diem an idiom?
 <olamachon>  carpe svnus?
   <rindolf>  Carpe svni?
 <olamachon>  ^
   <rindolf>  Carpe svna?
   <rindolf>  Carpe svnis?
   <rindolf>  Not sure.
   <rindolf>  My Latin is weak.
   <rindolf>  I know the plural of Pentium is Pentia.
      <pyon>  olamachon: "Carpe diem" means something like "live/enjoy
              this day"
 <olamachon>  pyon: Seize the day
      <pyon>  Yeah.
   <rindolf>  Well, carpe meant quite a few things.
   <rindolf>  In Latin at least.
 <olamachon>  This is unbelievably slow. On a 1gbps connection, php docs
              have been downloading for 15 minutes so far
   <rindolf>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem
   <rindolf>  olamachon: I see.
 <olamachon>  I'm trying to grab it all incase I need it later, but with
              my luck it will drop out again before the 1 file I need

     <Denommus>  Binary_Digit: uh, src?
       <indigo>  Binary_Digit: projects
        <pulse>  i thought he meant the project name folder
 <Binary_Digit>  src is fine if you're only ever going to write one

     <Denommus>  ah, for the directory where the projects will be!
     <Denommus>  I always name it "Projects"
 <Binary_Digit>  all your programs are called 'Projects'?
         <they>  Shouldn't you use a top-level qualifier?
 <Binary_Digit>  Cool.
        <pulse>  lol
     <Denommus>  Binary_Digit: no, the directory where the projects are
         <they>  For instance, if you're making a library called "Jail",
                 have the top-level folder named "Jail"? So the namespaces
                 below would be "Jail.Whatever"?

     <Denommus>  they: yup
 <Binary_Digit>  Q: How do I do <foo>? A: easy, just use Projects to do
                 the first bit, then switch to Projects to do the next
                 bit, and pipe the output through Projects
              *  jrslepak just names a project's directory based on the

 <Binary_Digit>  Denommus solves it by calling every project 'Projects'
     <jrslepak>  Binary_Digit: what problem do I have?
 <Binary_Digit>  But I prefer to find more original names
        <pulse>  i'm afraid i'm going to pick some well-known name, then
                 i'll get sued and will have to walk around in a barrel
 <Binary_Digit>  jrslepak, the problem of picking a name for your project
     <Denommus>  Binary_Digit: stop putting words on my mouth, I hate it

      <rindolf>  benzrf: I had a lot of them in a recent Project Euler
                 problem.
 <Binary_Digit>  I think I shall call my latest project Bernard. Or
                 possibly Saskatchewan.
        <pulse>  Binary_Digit, i find you could develop all sorts of names

 <Binary_Digit>  I don't suppose any of those are taken
        <pulse>  tomatomation

        <pulse>  stands for tomato automation
 <Binary_Digit>  I suppose the only way out is to pick a good name

                 to fit that name. eg Project Turnip could be a Turing

  <protist>  rindolf: you are obsessed with her :p
  <rindolf>  And the father divorced her mother and left her mother to
             raise her on her own, kinda like SMG in real life.
  <rindolf>  protist: I *iz* obsessed with her.
  <rindolf>  protist: she was one of my first loves.
  <protist>  rindolf: haha
  <rindolf>  protist: I was recently obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence too -
             I like the alpha female/insurgent/antagonist/rebel type of

  <rindolf>  protist: over at the Technion , I kinda hit on a girl with a
             nose ring who coloured her hair black, but she turned out to
             already have a bf.
  <rindolf>  protist: since then I realised I should be more honest and
             direct and also reduce the round-trip/time-to-market delay.
  <protist>  rindolf: round-trip/time-to-market delay?
  <protist>  rindolf: and a lot of girls will just say they have a
             boyfriend :p...and sometimes they do it to test you, because
             oddly they are only interested in a guy who persists in spite
             of the fake boyfriend
 <Jck_true>  protist: Yeah you might not wanna mention ROI [= "Return On
             Investment"] when you're asking a girl on a date...
  <protist>  rindolf: but sometimes it is lack of interest...and sometimes
             they really do have a boyfriend
  <protist>  Jck_true: what do you mean? :p

  <protist>  pyon: When do you ever remember girls being simple?

 <HikaruBG>  Svetlana, just take a 15 and step out from the office. Then

 <HikaruBG>  on another hand, Svetlana, where are you trying to deploy

  <rindolf>  Well, boys will be boys (and girls will be girls).

   <rindolf>  In my imagination, my concept at the time of
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar , who
              was a relatively wild and polyamorous girl (but still an
              awesome one) decided to duplicate herself and then said "I
              am going to call my new self 'Valentine'". So she gets
              duplicated and her duplicate then says "So I'm Valentine,
              right?"
  <njcomsec>  does polyamorous mean a slut?
   <rindolf>  njcomsec: well, not exactly.
   <rindolf>  njcomsec: thing is - she was very picky about which guys she
              got involved with. But if she slept with you once, you don't
              need to worry about it happening again.
      <pyon>  Is it not possible to have a fixed, small but non-singleton
              set of romantic partners?
   <rindolf>  pyon: what does that mean?
  <njcomsec>  i wouldnt worry about it :)
  <njcomsec>  in fact i would worry she might NOT want to again
  <njcomsec>  pyon i believe that is called open relationship
  <njcomsec>  i am open to this idea
  <njcomsec>  but so far i cant even find one nice girl who will date me
  <njcomsec>  so this is the first step
 <o0elise0o>  i have this problem where if i sleep with someone i usually
              dont want to ever again
  <njcomsec>  thats cute
      <pyon>  rindolf: A singleton set is a set with exactly one element.
              A small, non-singleton set of romantic partners would be,
              for example, having two or three romantic partners, but not
              having sex with arbitrary people.
   <rindolf>  Also , Miranda Kerr recently bragged about all the great sex
              she's been getting with various willing men after being
              separated from her husband (= Orlando Bloom). I say - all
              the power to her.
   <rindolf>  pyon: ah.
   <rindolf>  pyon: well, she had a fixed (But often growin or getting
              reduced) set of those.
      <pyon>  rindolf: Well... if it is often growing or shrinking, it is
              not fixed.
   <gde33|2>  o0elise0o: try costumes
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJgYxWhDDWc
   <rindolf>  pyon: ah.
   <rindolf>  pyon: well, if her lovers had entered a relationship, she
              stopped sleeping with them.
   <rindolf>  pyon: although not permanently.
      <pyon>  rindolf: Ah!
   <rindolf>  I imagined a short students' film about Valentine Gellar's
              life.
   <rindolf>  It starts with showing her riding a bus and then there are
              the immortal words "I used to be Sarah Michelle Gellar".
   <rindolf>  And Valentine had a steady boyfriend and also studied for a
              Ph.D. Well, she's a professor now.
   <rindolf>  Anyway, at one point she visits her and Sarah's mother, who
              admits that while she knows that Valentine is technically
              her daughter, she causes her so few troubles and is so
              great, that she has a hard time thinking of her as her
              daughter - she's more like a younger friend.
   <gde33|2>  rindolf: you are spoiling the whole movie!
   <rindolf>  gde33|2: heh, it's not a real film.
   <gde33|2>  you underacheaver!
   <gde33|2>  I say, make it so
   <rindolf>  And then she visits a guy and sees that his room is in
              disarray and after she queries him for this he says "Ah,
              yes, Sarah was here last night. We had an awesome time." So
              Valentine says: "She couldn't have been! She stayed up late
              at a benefit and went to bed past 1 AM exhausted." . So he
              thinks for a moment and says: "So it wasn't her! No biggie."

   <rindolf>  KAROLINA: no, I'm Fluttershy.

              recall some memories from their mutual past together.

    <rindolf>  I also saw a lady sitting on a bench with two Pekinese dogs
               - one male and one female.
    <rindolf>  they barked at me.
    <rindolf>  Maybe she was afraid of me (their owner I mean).
     <ezrios>  dogs bark at everything
    <rindolf>  I also saw some bird watchers in the park earlier in the

    <rindolf>  ezrios: some dogs are amazingly calm.
    <rindolf>  ezrios: I once met a huge Caucasian Shepherd dog who was

               super-calm.
    <rindolf>  His owner was also very friendly.
     <ezrios>  a super-calm Rambo eh
 <epitamizor>  cool story bro

     <thecha>  ok i will try
     <thecha>  the dog probably ws being agressive because the owners mood
               was affecting him
     <thecha>  the owner probably was being hostile so the dog followed
               suit
     <thecha>  and the guy with the kids should have just said the names
               isntead of being a dick about it
     <thecha>  you go for walks often?
    <rindolf>  thecha: yes, I go for walks a lot.
    <rindolf>  thecha: yes, this father should learn some things after
               fatherhood.
    <rindolf>  thecha: the children were nice.
    <rindolf>  Oh! and on the way upstairs there was a very young boy with
               a toy gun and I pretended to wage an imaginary war with
               him. He enjoyed it.
     <thecha>  rindolf-> who won the imaginary shoot out?
    <rindolf>  thecha: he did I think.
    <rindolf>  thecha: I let him win.
    <rindolf>  thecha: he seemed to have enjoyed it.
    <rindolf>  thecha: children can be so smart.
      <pulse>  i don't think age has anything to do with smartness
    <rindolf>  thecha: and it helped brighten my day.
    <rindolf>  pulse: yes.
    <rindolf>  pulse: I have actually grown smarter with age.
      <pulse>  i've grown wiser. not much smarter
    <rindolf>  pulse: ah.
    <rindolf>  pulse: what's your distinction?
    <rindolf>  pulse: I've grown wiser too.
      <pulse>  smart is the ability to calculate things fast
      <pulse>  wise is the ability to live your life ;)
    <rindolf>  pulse: there are more parameters to intelligence than doing
               fast calculations.
      <pulse>  i guess there's certain correlation between the two
    <rindolf>  pulse: yes.
      <pulse>  i know. there's different types of intelligence
      <pulse>  but most types boil down to two things. calculations and
               speed
    <rindolf>  pulse: ah. IQ?

 <rindolf>  aidanh: I've solved PRoject Euler #141 yesterday and learned a
            valuable lesson about excessive forking to processes and
            capturing their output.
 <Snake2k>  rindolf: Indeed >_>
 <rindolf>  Namely: it kills performance.
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: where do you live?
 <Snake2k>  rindolf: I need to start doing Project Euler again :|
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: ah.
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: we can become friends there.
 <Snake2k>  rindolf: Northern Virginia, pretty much a mile or two away
            from D.C.
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: ah.
 <Snake2k>  rindolf: We can still be friends >_>
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: heh.
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: I don't friend Northern Virginians!
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: ;-)
         *  Snake2k does "gcc -Wall hug_rindolf.c -o hug --std=c11"
         *  Snake2k does "./hug"
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: southern virginians on the other hand...
         *  Snake2k gets "Segmentation Fault (core dumped)"
 <Snake2k>  rindolf: Why? :'( we're nice and shit :(
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: heh, I'm just joking.
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: I'm cool with Northern Virginians.
    <Twey>  rindolf: ‘It kills performance’ — depends on your definition
            of ‘process’. POSIX processes are huge, but green threads in
            e.g. Haskell or Erlang are usually very cheap and can be used
            without much consideration.
         *  DarkCthulhu has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
 <rindolf>  Twey: I Was talking about POSIX processes.
 <rindolf>  Twey: I captured the output of "factor" for convenience, and
            it proved to be a major slowdown.
 <rindolf>  Twey: ERLANG! Munctional! Parallelism!
 <Snake2k>  rindolf: but you hurt ma feelz :'(
 <rindolf>  Snake2k: heh.
   <Tawre>  Snake2k, just commit violence against him
   <Tawre>  it'll fix everything
   <Tawre>  and if it doesn't you're not using enough violence
 <Snake2k>  Tawre: good idea :|
         *  Snake2k hugs the living rindolf out of rindolf
    <Myrl>  I wonder if normal algebra would be fine with you using lambda
            functions.
         *  rindolf sends 1e12 virtual kisses to Northern Virginia.
    <Myrl>  Or curried functions.
         *  Tawre kisses rindolf 0e13 times.
    <Myrl>  guys get a room.
 <rindolf>  Tawre: heh.
 <rindolf>  Myrl: we got ##programming !
 <Snake2k>  this is getting weird...
 <rindolf>  It's a chat-room!
 <Snake2k>  I hug... I don't do virtual kisses...
         *  Snake2k slithers away...
         *  Snake2k is all creeped out and shit...
 <rindolf>  s/kisses/hugs/
   <Tawre>  Snake2k, well, we can kill it "hugs" too if you want ;)
         *  Snake2k slithers back
 <Snake2k>  Tawre: <______________<
    <Twey>  rindolf: ‘Parallelism’ — er… yeah. That's what you wanted :þ
   <Tawre>  we can do parallel hugs too

 <_blizzy_>  lol at people who are looking to hire people who have 3 years
             experience of Swift.
    <pulse>  i have 1 year of experience with Swift and i've developed a
             minor depression in that time
    <pulse>  should i sue oracle?
 <apotheon>  I love how everyone who wrote three lines of code for the
             Linux kernel these days can now refer to his or her code
             running on things somewhere other than Earth to make
             themselves sound good, now.
  <rindolf>  _blizzy_: heh.
 <_blizzy_>  I have 4 years experience with Swift and 10 years experience
             of Node.
 <_blizzy_>  hire me.
  <rindolf>  _blizzy_: wasn't Swift created less than a year ago?
 <_blizzy_>  rindolf, that's the joke.
  <rindolf>  _blizzy_: yes.
    <pulse>  oh, you mean Swift
    <pulse>  as in apple
 <_blizzy_>  node wasn't around also 10 years ago.
  <rindolf>  _blizzy_: yes.
 <_blizzy_>  rindolf, oh.
 <_blizzy_>  https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/320ujx/why_cant_programmers_program_is_print_100_to_1/
    <pulse>  could they choose a more stupid name
 <_blizzy_>  I tripped on that problem.
 <apotheon>  _blizzy_: If you don't have thirty years of experience with
             Java, you don't qualify.
    <pulse>  only if they called it PHP 2 maybe it would be stupider
 <_blizzy_>  print 100 -> 1, but start with (for i=0
  <rindolf>  _blizzy_: «Chuck Norris has 50 years of proven experience in
             PHP/MySQL/Java. Each.»
 <_blizzy_>  rindolf, Chuck Norris made a new sorting algorithm.
 <_blizzy_>  roundhouse sorting.
    <pulse>  chuck norris once outrun himself
 <_blizzy_>  2003.
 <_blizzy_>  I hope no one
 <_blizzy_>  attempts to crash my app. c:
  <wei2912>  rindolf: chuck norris can compile any randomly generated code
             with GCC
  <rindolf>  wei2912: :-)
 <apotheon>  That's impressive. GCC sometimes doesn't even compile
             standards compliant code.
    <pulse>  chuck norris can roll a joint while swimming
 <_blizzy_>  CN slammed a revolving door.
     <Twey>  pulse: They could have chosen a much stupider name, like
             ‘Go’.
 <_blizzy_>  Twey, or Java
  <wei2912>  lmao
 <_blizzy_>  I kid.
    <pulse>  Twey, well at least Go doesn't have any bad connotations ...
             as far as i know
 <_blizzy_>  GO is actually
 <_blizzy_>  decent.
          *  Twey resolves to call his next project ‘The’
 <apotheon>  Java isn't a stupid name. It was just ruined by association
             with the language.
    <pulse>  when i hear Swift, all i can think of is those horrible
             layout patterns in Netbeans
  <rindolf>  wei2912: Chuck Norris once wrote a 10 million lines C++
             program in MS Notepad without hitting the backspace key. And
             it compiled without errors or warnings and was 100% bug free.
 <_blizzy_>  Java is bad imo.
     <Twey>  pulse: I mostly think of the bird
    <pulse>  chuck norris once made a program that was 110% bug free
  <wei2912>  rindolf: Chuck Norris once wrote Swift Swiftly
  <rindolf>  pulse: and he donated the extra 10% for charity.
 <_blizzy_>  Chuck Norris once wrote a Whitespace program without
             whitespace.
 <apotheon>  pulse: Only once? Slacker.
    <pulse>  rindolf, :D
  <wei2912>  he Goes on to write Go
     <Twey>  _blizzy_: That's easy
      <ams>  isn't everything readable in go by default?
    <pulse>  ams, that's what they said about Python
 <apotheon>  Go is an excellent Java replacement.
      <ams>  :-)
     <Twey>  _blizzy_: (the empty program is a valid Whitespace program)
 <_blizzy_>  Twey, oh.
 <_blizzy_>  time to learn meteor.
    <pulse>  i imagine it's possible to open a wormhole to another
             dimension using just javascript
 <_blizzy_>  it's possible in Python
 <_blizzy_>  import wormhole
 <apotheon>  _blizzy_: I hear excellent things about Meteor. I also hear
             bad things . . . like the fact it's a JavaScript framework.
    <pulse>  _blizzy_, from __future__?
 <_blizzy_>  pulse, of course.
  <wei2912>  heh
 <apotheon>  pulse: Yes, that's possible, but only if you do it by
             accident.
 <apotheon>  (re: JavaScript)
 <_blizzy_>  you gotta add 'use strict'; for it to work.
  <Znoosey>  pulse: why would a wormhole be to another dimension?
 <apotheon>  I'm pretty sure neither Python nor JavaScript uses strict.
 <_blizzy_>  JS does.
  <Znoosey>  pulse: wormholes goes to other places in the galaxy, it does
             not move between dimensions
    <pulse>  Znoosey, i thought all wormholes lead to dimensions with
             silly rabbits and such
 <apotheon>  Srsly? I clearly haven't been writing "enough" JavaScript.
 <_blizzy_>  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
 <apotheon>  I haven't yet encountered that.
  <Znoosey>  galaxy = universe
    <pulse>  apotheon, yeah, JS has use strict :L
    <pulse>  Znoosey, wat
  <Znoosey>  in my sentence it is!
     <Twey>  As a string.
  <Znoosey>  I just messed it up :P
    <pulse>  galaxy is a subset of the universe
     <Twey>  I thought that was a joke about Python's True = False
    <pulse>  a universe might be a subset of a multiverse :P
  <Znoosey>  pulse: yes, I messed it up in my sentence
    <pulse>  a multiverse might be a subset of itself o_O
  <Znoosey>  a multiverse is a subset of space
    <pulse>  well what is space then
  <Znoosey>  space might be infinite
 <_blizzy_>  why is True = False even legal
 <_blizzy_>  in Python.
    <pulse>  _blizzy_, because of reasons
    <pulse>  it's illegal in 3.0 afaik
     <Twey>  _blizzy_: It's not in Py3
 <_blizzy_>  omg
 <apotheon>  pulse: I think that instead of "galaxy = universe" what
             Znoosey meant was "s/galaxy/universe/".
 <_blizzy_>  somehow sneak True = False into a python 2 program
    <fykos>  Guys, why the arraylist only adds the last token to the
             list?http://pastebin.com/YbHLEqnA

      <rindolf>  xeno: a matrix is two-dimensional.
         <xeno>  only inside the matrix
      <rindolf>  xeno: maybe an Evil Genius convinced us that matrices are
                 a valid mathematical concept.
         <Twey>  Matrices are just a special case of tensors.
         <xeno>  rindolf: that's likely, but you don't even need that...

               eaten by those cats in their life!
      <pulse>  ah.
      <pulse>  i don't mind cats eating meat
       <adsc>  and he'll increase the corn that's eaten by mice
       <adsc>  which increases world hunger
       <adsc>  so it's bad to eat cats
       <adsc>  better eat dogs
       <adsc>  they are useless
       <adsc>  although I guess they to have a positive impact on sales of
               the shoe industry
       <adsc>  so maybe it's not good to eat dogs either, or the shoe
               industry will falter
      <pulse>  now i'm not hungry anymore
      <pulse>  so this chat was somewhat beneficial

          <rindolf>  Hi all.
        <DrIranian>  hiiiiiii :)
          <rindolf>  DrIranian: can I take one of your "i"s?
                  *  DrIranian agrees after long consideration
                  *  rindolf takes one of DrIranian 's "i" and colours it
                     hot pink.
 <iwanttobreakfree>  how old were you when you first started programming?
                     i was 15-16
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: I was about 10.
        <DrIranian>  :D
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: I wrote in XT BIOS BASIC.
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: what did you write in?
        <DrIranian>  rindolf: Girls calling me housewife, asking me for
                     cooking advice, and now you paint my i pink :D
 <iwanttobreakfree>  PaScAl
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: ah, Pascal.
            <pulse>  iwanttobreakfree, 12-13ish
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: a Bondage-and-Discipline language.
          <rindolf>  Mostly dead now.
        <vdamewood>  I feel a need to write more stuff.
 <iwanttobreakfree>  you have higher IQ then i guess
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: what makes you think that?
 <iwanttobreakfree>  dunno
        <vdamewood>  I have a book on Pascal that I've never actually
                     read.
 <iwanttobreakfree>  it seemed to simple?
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: and IQ is a silly measurement of
                     intelligence not to say competence and performance.
        <DrIranian>  IQ is good for a basic measurement
        <vdamewood>  I once passed an IQ test.
        <vdamewood>  > 60 is passing, right?
        <DrIranian>  :(
 <iwanttobreakfree>  actually you can have super high competence, but when
                     you don't want to do the job, then it doesn't count
        <DrIranian>  105 is passing
        <DrIranian>  vdamewood: if you can turn on IRC, you probably have
                     105
          <rindolf>  isn't the average IQ 90?
        <vdamewood>  rindolf: 100
      <Serpentine_>  Values below a small threshold deviating from 100 are
                     generally very inaccurate
          <rindolf>  DrIranian: "turn on IRC"?
        <DrIranian>  rindolf: The same IQ in different countries is not
                     the same
      <Serpentine_>  100 points is defined as the mean and median in IQ
                     tests
            <Zeno`>  no wonder people are so stupid
                  *  vdamewood passed Zeno` the state-sponsored happy
                     pills.
          <rindolf>  vdamewood: Black Bile!
        <Myrl-saki>  Guys.
          <rindolf>  Myrl-saki: and girls.
                  *  vdamewood gives rindolf some Yellow bile to balance
                     his humors.
          <rindolf>  vdamewood: I want hot pink bile.
                  *  DrIranian seconds
        <DrIranian>  I want pink bile
          <rindolf>  vdamewood: so it will match the colour of DrIranian
                     's "i".
        <vdamewood>  rindolf: Your only other choices are blood and phlegm
        <vdamewood>  I can give you a mixture of 1 parts blood, 5 parts
                     phlegm
          <rindolf>  vdamewood: that's OK, I still have a lot of hot pink
                     paint left to colour that bile.
        <DrIranian>  vdamewood: those are the standard options, we are
                     talking about tuning the fluids
          <rindolf>  LOL.
        <Myrl-saki>  Wtf is happening.
        <Myrl-saki>  `echo 'a' > Foo`
        <Myrl-saki>  Then reading it in, say, Haskell and Java, it's "a\n"
          <rindolf>  Myrl-saki: echo appends a newline by default.
          <rindolf>  Myrl-saki: you can use echo -n IIRC
          <rindolf>  not sure how portable -n is.
        <Myrl-saki>  rindolf: Oh, I see.
        <vdamewood>  IIRC --> In internet-relay chat
        <Myrl-saki>  rindolf: That doesn't explain why vim and nano also
                     saves that way though.
        <vdamewood>  Because vim and nano assume you want a new line at
                     the end of your text file.
        <Myrl-saki>  vdamewood: I see.
          <rindolf>  Myrl-saki: it's a configuration option.
          <rindolf>  Myrl-saki: kate doesn't do it by default.
        <Myrl-saki>  vdamewood: Why though?
                  *  rindolf colours the newline hot pink.
        <vdamewood>  Because they're text files.
        <Myrl-saki>  vdamewood: What's the benefit of such?
 <iwanttobreakfree>  guys i have a genius idea: to make a programming
                     language which supports all syntaxes ( func.
                     programming, logic programming, OOP, etc)
        <Myrl-saki>  iwanttobreakfree: lol
          <rindolf>  Myrl-saki: for once cat $file works nicer.
        <vdamewood>  iwanttobreakfree: C++?
        <DrIranian>  iwanttobreakfree: is this back in the future?
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: syntaxes or semanticses?
 <iwanttobreakfree>  it doesn't support func programming and logic pr.
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: or do you mean paradigms?
 <iwanttobreakfree>  everything!
                  *  vdamewood gives rindolf 20 cents.
        <vdamewood>  (That's a pair o' dimes)
                  *  Archer gives iwanttobreakfree 60secs to say something
                     intelligent
 <iwanttobreakfree>  it's all mixed up. you can program everything with it
                  *  rindolf colours 10 of these cents hot pink.
                  *  vdamewood pats Archer on the head.
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: we have a saying in Hebrew : "Catch
                     a lot - didn't catch anything"
        <vdamewood>  Looks like 60 seconds are up.
 <iwanttobreakfree>  such a approach would result a highly effective
                     program code and it would save thousands of human
                     lives and it's a work of a lifetime for some people.
          <rindolf>  iwanttobreakfree: also, reportedly Linus Torvalds
                     once said that his primary responsibility as the
                     chief developer of the Linux kernel is to say "No.".
 <iwanttobreakfree>  i mean, you know logic programming languages and
                     func. you know the differences? when you can mix
                     them, then you could have better code
             <snyp>  void free() { abort(); }
      <Serpentine_>  iwanttobreakfree: You may have misspelled "Python"
        <vdamewood>  snyp: void *malloc(size_t sz) { return (void*)rand();
                     }
             <sbrg>  void* malloc(size_t sz) { real_malloc(3 * sz); return

   <SillyMusings>  How much money can I expect to make as a developer out
                   of college?
 <quelqun_dautre>  SillyMusings: 0$. Tax deduced.
        <rindolf>  quelqun_dautre: well, that's a lower bound.
        <rindolf>  SillyMusings: the correct answer is that it varies
                   based on several parameters.
   <SillyMusings>  rindolf, what are the parameters?
 <quelqun_dautre>  what you know, what framework you can use, how good you
                   are in an interview, where you are
        <rindolf>  SillyMusings: 1. Where are you located. 2. Which
                   languages do you know. 3. where you'll get hired.
   <SillyMusings>  I know Javascript and Java
 <quelqun_dautre>  where are you located ?
        <rindolf>  SillyMusings: it's spelled "JavaScript" - not
                   "Javascript"
   <SillyMusings>  I am located in Oregon
     <little_bit>  how much money you'll make is not a function of any of
                   those inputs.
 <quelqun_dautre>  and how good are you at Java[script] ?
     <little_bit>  sad to say it's barely a function at all.
                   predictability in terms of actual earnings is
                   impossible these days.
   <SillyMusings>  I'd say I'm okay at it
        <rindolf>  quelqun_dautre: Java and JavaScript are two completely
                   different things.
     <little_bit>  if you want some examples, look at GlassDoor.
   <SillyMusings>  What sort of range am I looking at?
     <little_bit>  SillyMusings: GlassDoor.
 <quelqun_dautre>  rindolf: I know.
     <little_bit>  SillyMusings: anything from us will be an incomplete
                   picture.
     <little_bit>  SillyMusings: so draw from multiple sources.
   <SillyMusings>  If I'm fresh out of college, am I a 'junior developer'?
     <little_bit>  probably. god knows what you'll be placed into.
 <quelqun_dautre>  SillyMusings: what is "okay" on your terms ? Do you
                   know the play framework ? J2EE ?
     <little_bit>  SillyMusings: I certainly hope you aren't expecting a
                   lot of money.
   <SillyMusings>  quelqun_dautre, no I'm stronger on the JS side
          <pilne>  java and javascript are often used in the same
                   "completed" project these days, but they are completely
                   different beasts for better or worse
   <SillyMusings>  little_bit, glassdoor says average of 103k?
        <rindolf>  quelqun_dautre: http://stackoverflow.com/a/245073 -
                   case in point. ;-)
     <little_bit>  SillyMusings: for what position?
     <little_bit>  and where?
          <pilne>  javascript is relatively strong right now due to
                   node.js, it isn't ideal for *everything* but it can do
                   a lot
                *  rindolf thinks serving Java web applets from a Node.js
                   service is bestest
     <TubbyTommy>  JavaScript is relatively strong on it's own because
                   they keep making it better, its not ever finished
                   really
   <SillyMusings>  yes I've been following es6 stuff
          <pilne>  erm... rindolf?
        <rindolf>  pilne: that was a joke! Relax!
          <pilne>  yeah, but it is starting to add cruft
 <quelqun_dautre>  SillyMusings: what do you know in JS ? What library can
                   you use ? Ever used functional programming ? Do you
                   know what a closure is ?
          <pilne>  LOL i would hope so rindolf, that isn't impossible, i
                   just can't see why you'd do it other than being a
                   code-massochist
     <little_bit>  SillyMusings: I'm going to assume you're fresh out of
                   college, so let me make this clear: you're not getting
                   those jobs.

 <vdamewood>  Maybe I should make an IDE.
 <vdamewood>  One that doesn't suck.
   <rindolf>  varesa: one thing I don't understand about JetBrains is why
              they have so many IDEs with a common codebase and different
              feature-sets. seems like a bad money-making scheme.
   <rindolf>  vdamewood: it likely will suck. :-).
 <vdamewood>  This coming from the guy who explains why all languages
              suck.

              X, and completely obliterates every other X out there.

   <rindolf>  nso95: I woke up a while ago.
     <nso95>  ah/
   <rindolf>  nso95: and I am unable to reproduce the short benchmarking
              time I got yesterday. I've lost faith in humanity.
     <nso95>  that’s rather unfortunate
 <vdamewood>  My co workers: https://xkcd.com/1597/
     <nso95>  this next semester is going to suck
 <vdamewood>  The next semester always sucks, except the one after your
              last.
 <vdamewood>  jeaye: There's no need for another bootloader either, but
              here I am.
     <jeaye>  That's different.
     <jeaye>  "One that doesn't suck." is the key point.
     <jeaye>  You didn't say that about the bootloader.
 <vdamewood>  Oh, yeah. I have no real goal to make mine not suck. Good

      <_ic2000>  that feeling when someone tells me they found python too
                 hard so they're going to learn C because it's "easy and
                 not outdated"...
    <Brando753>  _ic2000: its not outdated :P but yea that is a silly
                 thing to say
      <_ic2000>  Brando753, but they were implying that python was
                 outdated lol
    <Brando753>  _ic2000: yea thats pretty bad
    <Brando753>  _ic2000: python is awesome
    <Brando753>  I love C
    <Brando753>  I really do but I would never program what I do in python
                 in C
 <magneticduck>  are you sure you love C?
    <Brando753>  magneticduck: its a love hate relationship :I
        <pulse>  i would like to see if i love C while i'm out at sea
    <Brando753>  lol
 <magneticduck>  I think a relationship a developer might have with C is
                 less love, more codependency
       <nso95_>  he hits me because he loves me
    <Brando753>  nso95_: exactly!
 <magneticduck>  he segfaults because he trusts me
       <gmurop>  So you don't love C, C loves you
        <pulse>  C lovers ~-> clovers
        <pulse>  it was meant to be
      <rindolf>  magneticduck: heh.
      <rindolf>  magneticduck: LOL.
    <Brando753>  magneticduck: he works perfectly in the debugger then
                 crashes normally because he loves you
    <Brando753>  all that C love
    <Brando753>  C would be miserable without valgrind
    <Brando753>  and GDB
      <rindolf>  Brando753: heh.
 <magneticduck>  when he corrupts all over my memory, he's just venting
                 his anger from work
 <magneticduck>  it's normal, all languages do that
      <rindolf>  magneticduck: heh.
       <nso95_>  I fell down the stairs
    <Brando753>  nso95_: did C push you?
      <rindolf>  nso95_: that sucks.
    <Brando753>  nso95_: or are you being serious, in which case sorry :I
       <nso95_>  nah, jk
    <Brando753>  :D
      <rindolf>  nso95_: ah.

       <rindolf>  Zuu: some people told me they think a Freecell/etc.
                  solver is useless, but it has some uses and is my most
                  popular project todate.
           <Zuu>  I’m mostly surprised that you can find the spirit to
                  work on it for so long.
           <Zuu>  like, so many years.
           <Zuu>  But as long as you find the time to distribute Santas
                  presents, it's all good :P
       <rindolf>  Zuu: I actually don't distribute Santa's presents - that
                  is goody-two-shoes-reindeer's job. Being an EvilReindeer
                  I do the opposite - I steal all the presents to maintain
                  balance in the force.
   <bizarrefish>  rindolf: Do you have an evil master?
           <Zuu>  rindolf, Noooooh!
   <bizarrefish>  Perhaps a jolly one?
       <rindolf>  bizarrefish: no! I'm my own master.
           <Zuu>  rindolf, that's too evil! :<
       <rindolf>  bizarrefish: but I have some collaborators.
       <rindolf>  Zuu, bizarrefish : we use

           <Zuu>  rindolf, i bet there's someone who just injects these
                  thoughts into your head when christmas is over, and just
                  before christmas starts, they inject rudolph thoughts
                  into your head :>
       <rindolf>  Zuu: my plan for this year is to cancel Christmas
                  altogether.
       <rindolf>  and replace it with EvilChristmas
           <Zuu>  rindolf, If i dont get presents, i know who's fault it
                  is now :P
       <rindolf>  Zuu: you'll get EvilPresents this time. ;-)
     <Brando753>  rindolf: D: but I liked non-evil christmas, non-evil
                  Santa Claus was always so nice and jolly
     <Brando753>  And getting presents which dont try and do evil
                  unspeakable things to you is nice as well

 <EvilBrando753>  rindolf: good old wikipedia
 <EvilBrando753>  never realized there used to be a supreme court ruiling

 <EvilBrando753>  which is insane to think about
       <rindolf>  EvilBrando753: ah, I see.
       <rindolf>  EvilBrando753: wikipedia may be good, but it's not too
                  old.
 <EvilBrando753>  I just want a printed copy of wikipedia for the sake of
                  having one

  <MisterSyntax>  rindolf, want some? :D

       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: isn't a dungeon supposed to be
                  underground?
  <MisterSyntax>  yeah but it's a tower.. in a dungeon
        <nitrix>  I put on my robe and wizard hat...
  <MisterSyntax>  so imagine a great cave
  <MisterSyntax>  with numberous caves joined to it
  <MisterSyntax>  and in that great cave theres a tower
  <MisterSyntax>  and at the top of that tower is my room with a nice
                  window overviewing the magmaflow of the earth.
  <MisterSyntax>  ;-)
       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: I wonder how you get an Internet

  <MisterSyntax>  hahahahahah
       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: heh.
  <MisterSyntax>  no i'm tapping internet from an industrial fibercable

  <MisterSyntax>  yes
       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: nice.
  <MisterSyntax>  rindolf, i had to, my sisters' kids wanted to watch it
                  whilst i was supervising
  <MisterSyntax>  and i like to act like a child when watching movies or
                  playing with toys so it was quite fun xD
  <MisterSyntax>  even built them a mayan pyramid afterwards made out of
                  duplo lol
  <MisterSyntax>  well mayan
  <MisterSyntax>  http://www.crystalinks.com/pyramidelcastillo.jpg << that
                  kind
  <MisterSyntax>  no clue if its mayan
       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: nice.
  <MisterSyntax>  they were amazed and kept it for months, even built a
                  whole city around it themselves
       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: I think it is.
  <MisterSyntax>  yeah rindolf i think as well but ain't sure xD
       <rindolf>  MisterSyntax: the Mayan Pyramids look nicer than the
                  egyptian ones IMO.
  <MisterSyntax>  rindolf, agreed.
  <MisterSyntax>  here have another demon..
               *  MisterSyntax points at demon nr.4

                    what exactly is going on in their heads when they
                    determine that renaming os x to macOS might increase
                    sales or whatever apple is trying to achieve

                    and been trying to get them to use the correct
                    spelling and capitalisation and now it's different and
                    lamer.
       <SlashLife>  Isn't it called iOS now?

       <bacon1989>  no, that's iMobile, they renamed that yesterday in the
                    conf
       <SlashLife>  Seriously?
            <pyon>  rindolf: it's not a real english word, it's just a
                    product name - the only ones who should be worried
                    about properly spelling its name are apple themselves
         <rindolf>  SlashLife: iOS is different than Mac OS X.

  <njcomsec>  seems to break stuff
    <Rounin>  It's recently caused people to miss out on large parts of
              their exams
  <njcomsec>  at least on my computer
    <Rounin>  Since they were answering them on Windows computers
  <njcomsec>  but it might also be something to do with acer and mcaffee
    <Rounin>  That of course decided to reboot for 1,5 hours during the
              exams
  <njcomsec>  though teh windows update is definetly the catalyst
   <rindolf>  Rounin: "Windows Update ate my homework!"
    <Rounin>  rindolf: Brrr!
 <password2>  Rounin, Well
 <password2>  one would wonder why the poeple would set the settings on
              those pc to auto update
 <password2>  i blame the people using it
    <Rounin>  password2: They wouldn't... Windows set those settings
 <password2>  Rounin, you can change them
    <Rounin>  password2: That's not what we're discussing
  <njcomsec>  i believe windows updates are forced with win 10
 <password2>  why not?
    <Rounin>  password2: If someone robs you, you can also choose to get
              shot if you so desire
    <Rounin>  That doesn't mean it's your choice to get robbed
  <njcomsec>  you can disable them but i think it can cause problems
 <password2>  its seems like a cheap shot at windows
 <password2>  yeah
    <Rounin>  No, it doesn't
    <Rounin>  It doesn't seem like that at all
 <password2>  but no one was hurt
 <password2>  and no one plans on benig robbed
    <Rounin>  No one plans on having their exam ruined by Windows Update
              either, as far as I know
 <password2>  idk why you bothered with that comparison
   <rindolf>  For the life of me I cannot understand why Windows Update
              takes a while to do its thing *before* the system shutdown.
 <password2>  rindolf idk
 <password2>  btw Rounin if you want to blame default setting on windows ,
              you aparently have very little experience with linux
 <password2>  because thats like half the trouble with linuxx
    <Rounin>  password2: That's not true either... I don't apparently have
              very little experience with Linux

    <fanfan>  When should I use BitKeeper (peer-to-peer) and when should I
              use GitHub (client-server) for my software project?
    <yawkat>  fanfan: git is distributed
   <rindolf>  fanfan: why do you want to use BitKeeper?
   <rindolf>  fanfan: and git is distributed too.
    <fanfan>  rindolf, I didn't understand.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: git is peer-to-peer - just like BitKeeper.
    <fanfan>  rindolf, so when should I use Git and when should I use
              GitHub?
   <rindolf>  fanfan: there are other git services aside from GitHub and
              you can set up one of your own.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: you normally use git to interact with GitHub.
    <fanfan>  rindolf, I don't really know what should I do, can please
              guide me.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: use GitHub if you like it - if not - use a different
              git service provider.
    <fanfan>  rindolf, well I choose GitHub because there are already
              millions of people using it, so it seems trustworthy.
      <baum>  fanfan: same for bitbucket and others
    <fanfan>  baum, I will just use GitHub before I get crazy in all these
              options.
      <baum>  fanfan: you could also just use git
   <rindolf>  fanfan: it seems like a good choice at the moment.
   <rindolf>  baum: we told him that.
    <fanfan>  baum, So Git is better than BitKeeper?
 <catbadger>  git is better than everything
   <rindolf>  baum: this seems like one of those 'Should I use jQuery or
              JavaScript?' questions.
      <baum>  rindolf: oh i see, didn't read up. and yes it does
    <fanfan>  rindolf, I get it now, I people use GitHub because they
              don't have a server or online-storage, and they don't want
              to. But I have a server so I can just use BitKeeper.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: well, BitKeeper was made open source only relatively
              recently, which caused git (and previously other FOSS VCSes)
              to become popular instead.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: why do you want to use bitkeeper?
    <fanfan>  rindolf, because 15 years of development
   <rindolf>  fanfan: you can set up a git service on your server as well.
    <fanfan>  rindolf, and is supported by a big company
   <rindolf>  fanfan: well, git probably had more contributors.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: which big company supports BK?
    <fanfan>  rindolf, just please tell me, for god's sake, should I use
              GitHub or Git?
      <baum>  fanfan: if you are judging a source control solution by its
              company and years of existence maybe check out Visual
              SourceSafe :)
   <rindolf>  fanfan: I suggest you use git and you can opt to use GitHub
              as well.
   <rindolf>  baum: heh, I laughed-out-loud from that comment.
   <rindolf>  baum: can I tweet it?
    <fanfan>  rindolf, is GitHub best of its kind?
      <baum>  rindolf: go for it :)
    <mpetch>  used PVCS in an enterprise environment for many years with
              Nortel/BNR
   <rindolf>  baum: thanks!
    <fanfan>  okay guys, I will just use GitHub, before I get crAZY, now
              everyone shut up.
   <rindolf>  fanfan: great.
    <mpetch>  you sure you want to use github?
   <rindolf>  mpetch: be careful or you'll make him be like the child
              monster who wants to be "there" -
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m-kbBamg_U

                  *  bizarrefish was in malaysia last year :D
      <bizarrefish>  It's quite nice
      <bizarrefish>  Very friendly people
 <differentMonster>  bizarrefish : what about you ? well malaysia is hot
                     as hell.
      <bizarrefish>  I am in the UK, which is not hot
      <bizarrefish>  Malaysia was for a work trip
      <bizarrefish>  Was pretty cool
      <bizarrefish>  I think it's cool how Malaysian children stared at me
      <bizarrefish>  (I'm 6'4 and white)
      <bizarrefish>  Chinese people stare as well. I like that they find
                     me so interesting.
            <Yuken>  bizarrefish, if a Japanese guy passed through a rural
                     African village where everyone is black and 6'+
            <Yuken>  he'd probably be stared at as well! :p
      <bizarrefish>  heh
 <differentMonster>  bizarrefish : XD we will find you interesting for
                     sure ~
      <bizarrefish>  6ft4in is quite tall, even in the UK. It's a shame
                     nobody feels like they can stare
      <bizarrefish>  heh
 <differentMonster>  bizarrefish :cause you be different if you dont wear
                     or sound like we do.
            <Yuken>  bizarrefish, what if they have a height fetish and
                     start staring at you ominously?
            <Yuken>  :^)
      <bizarrefish>  When I go to very different countries, I just worry
                     that I might accidentally be rude.

      <bizarrefish>  Yuken: Then let them stare :) I'm happy for them to.
                     Just no touchy :D

                     then.
      <bizarrefish>  Myrl-saki: You can touch me if that makes it okay

                     buy it XD

  <rindolf>  Rashad: generalised Freecell was shown to be NP-complete
   <Rashad>  NP-complete means?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: here?
   <Rashad>  Yup.
   <Rashad>  Just came back.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: did you read about NP-completeness?
   <Rashad>  Nope.
   <Rashad>  What is it?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness
   <Rashad>  Too much math.
   <Rashad>  On wikipedia.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: see
             http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=memoir-from-a-Physics-lesson-in-the-9th-grade
   <Rashad>  rindolf: Sometimes formality can make things more complex
             than they really are.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: true
   <Rashad>  rindolf: Can you give me a simple introduction?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: well, do you know what polynomial time is?
   <Rashad>  No.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: hmmm...
   <Rashad>  I know what a polynomial is.
   <Rashad>  Is this related to the BigO notation?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: yes.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: polynomial time is O(P(N)) where P(N) is a polynomial
             of N
   <Rashad>  OK.
   <Rashad>  I am trying to think of an exaple..
   <Rashad>  example*
     <sbrg>  two nested loops
  <rindolf>  Rashad: so it can be O(n^2) or O(n) or O(n*log(n)) or even
             O(n**100)
   <Rashad>  Aha.
   <Rashad>  What is 'n'? Number of operations?
   <Rashad>  Umm.
   <Rashad>  Probably not.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: the length of the input
   <Rashad>  Yeah that makes sense.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: ok.
   <Rashad>  I remember stuff about search algorithms.
   <Rashad>  n is the number of entries in an array, for example.
     <sbrg>  yep
  <rindolf>  Rashad: now, some problems's *verification algorithm* is
             polynomial and these problemms are called "NP"
   <Rashad>  Verification algorithm?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: verification means you verify that the solution is
             correct after given one.
   <Rashad>  Aha.
     <sbrg>  Rashad: for example, if I give you a list and tell you that
             it's sorted, you can verify in polynomial time that it is
             correct
     <sbrg>  by simply checking each pair of elements
   <Rashad>  A solution in freecell is a series of moves?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: yes
   <Rashad>  sbrg: I see.
   <Rashad>  OK so NP *complete* means?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: now, some problems are NP-hard which means that each
             of them can be used to solve any problem in NP after a
             polynomial transformation.
     <sbrg>  and NP complete are problems which are both in NP and NP-hard
  <rindolf>  Rashad: yes, what sbrg said,
     <sbrg>  so, NP: a problem that, when given a solution, you can verify
             that it is correct in polynomial time
     <sbrg>  NP-hard: a class of problems that can be converted to each
             other
   <Rashad>  OK.
   <Rashad>  OK.
   <Rashad>  So NP-hard does not imply NP?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: no, not necessarily
  <kadoban>  No, problems that are harder than NP are in NP-hard too
   <Rashad>  Ahhh
   <Rashad>  Now that makes sense.
   <Rashad>  *at least NP hard*
  <rindolf>  Rashad: for instance, the Halting Problem is NP hard.
   <Rashad>  OK now everything is in place for me.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: good
  <kadoban>  It gets complicated because we don't know the actual hard
             relationships between many of the complexity classes, like we
             don't actually know if P = NP or if there are problems in NP
             that aren't in P. Which leads to the famous question you've
             likely heard of.
   <Rashad>  But I am interested by how you can map NP-hard problems from
             one to the other.
  <rindolf>  Rashad: there's a 1 million USD prize for proving whether P
             is NP or not,
   <Rashad>  kadoban: It got pretty philosophical fast :P
   <Rashad>  P = ?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: P is the class of polynomial problem,s
  <kadoban>  P, the complexity class above, which is problems you can
             solve in polynomial time on a deterministic turing machine.
   <Rashad>  I am a bit confused now..
  <kadoban>  NP, problems you can verify solutions to in polynomial time
             on a deterministic turing machine.
   <Rashad>  OK so NP is about verification, P is about solving. Correct?
  <rindolf>  Rashad: well yes, but you often want to find good solutions
             for NP problems
   <Rashad>  What do you mean?
  <kadoban>  Correct, though that's really just a definition used for
             picking which complexity class. In general we're still
             interested in getting the answer to problems in NP
   <Rashad>  Ah.
     <sbrg>  Rashad: P is the class of problems that can be *solved* in
             polynomial time. NP is the class of problems *whose solution
             can be verified* in polynomial time.
   <Rashad>  So the concern is: Can you find a solution to NP problems
             faster than you can verify the given solution?
     <sbrg>  Rashad: Assuming you mean "faster or as fast", well.. you
             just asked whether P = NP
   <Rashad>  I see.
     <sbrg>  if you have an answer to that question, someone will give you
             a million dollars
   <Rashad>  But how is that not a philosophical question, though?
   <Rashad>  Let me rephrase that.
  <kadoban>  It depends, what's a "philosophical question"?
     <sbrg>  kadoban: that is ^
     <sbrg>  lol
   <Rashad>  Wouldn't a solution imply a way to verify it?
  <kadoban>  But if you're asking if it has practical consequences, it
             does, potentially.
     <sbrg>  Rashad: Well, take sudoku as an example
   <Rashad>  OK!
     <sbrg>  If I give you a solved sudoku, how long would it take for you
             to verify it?
   <Rashad>  kadoban: What kind of consequences?
     <sbrg>  it's the same every time. you just make sure that 1 to 9
             appears in all rows, columns and boxes
   <Rashad>  sbrg: OK
     <sbrg>  however, does seeing the solution tell you how you solve it?
     <sbrg>  How as in, which steps
   <Rashad>  OK that's exactly what I am asking.
  <kadoban>  Rashad: For example if P = NP, then quite a lot of
             cryptography isn't very well founded. That would mean there
             were "quick" (in one way of speaking) algorithms to solve
             hard problems that crypto relies on, such as discrete
             logarithm and integer factorization.
   <Rashad>  How do you get an answer that is not completely random that
             in the same process of figuring it out you are unable to
             replicate the same logic into how you verify it?
   <Rashad>  And we're still talking about computers here so I am not sure
             if Newton's apple aha moment counts...
    <Gamah>  Rashad: sometimes it's easier to assert the validity a
             solution (P) than it is to explain it (NP)
    <Gamah>  or... those reversed
    <Gamah>  i forget.
     <sbrg>  Rashad: well, how easy is it to verify a sudoku? it's very
             easy. it's the same steps every time. however, does that
             knowledge of the rules of the game allow you to also solve
             the puzzle in an equal number of moves it took you to verify
             it?
   <Rashad>  sbrg: The solution however is ultimately guided by the rules
             of verification.
    <Gamah>  sbrg: poorly formed... technically speaking it can be easier
             to solve some given sudoko puzzles than it is to verify they
             are solved
   <Rashad>  Unless it is a complete shot in the dark.
     <sbrg>  Gamah: and there are lists that are already sorted. that
             doesn't change the lower bound for sorting. what's your
             point?
     <sbrg>  Rashad: Yes, it is. so one would think that it would be
             possible
     <sbrg>  and as Gamah pointed out, some sudokus are very easy to
             solve, while others are much harder
    <Gamah>  Rashad: no p
    <Gamah>  :P
     <sbrg>  the question is whether you can give an algorithm that
             guarantees that you can solve every sudoku within some time
             limit(in terms of the size of the input) that performs no
             more steps than you would verifying a sudoku
    <Gamah>  sbrg: i'm saying you can't apply the act of solving and the
             act of verifying a "solved" sudoko to p=np because in the
             space of sudoku, either task could be on either side of the
             equation
    <Gamah>  define "steps"
    <Gamah>  because it always takes less steps to solve than verify...
             from some perspective
   <Rashad>  rindolf: So solitaire is O(n)?
     <sbrg>  Gamah: you don't seem to understand complexity theory. we're
             talking about sudokus in general. I can verify *any* sudoku
             in some bounded polynomial time
   <Rashad>  Ah sorry, I meant verifying a solitaire solution is O(n)*.
    <Gamah>  you can also solve any sudoku
     <sbrg>  the question is whether I can somehow use the rules of
             verification to help me create a solution in at most as much
             time as it would take me to verify it. i.e. P vs NP
 <workmad3>  iirc, np-complete problems are ones where verifying a
             solution is polynomial time, but calculating a solution is
             non-polynomial
  <rindolf>  Rashad: there are many variants of card solitaire
    <Gamah>  sbrg: but the number of sudoku permetations and soultions is
             not unbound...
  <rindolf>  Rashad: generalised Freecell is NP-complete
  <rindolf>  Rashad: which assumes you have n ranks of cards insetad of 13
             (ace-to-king)
     <sbrg>  Gamah: for a 9x9 sudoku, no, obviously not. but we are
             talking about sudoku in general
    <Gamah>  hmm.
     <sbrg>  Rashad: at any rate, the point is that we just don't know
             whether we can use the information that lets us verify
             solutions in polynomial time to also construct solutions in
             polynomial time
    <Gamah>  i feel like sudoku is still a search problem (IE: rainbow
             table)
    <Gamah>  and not really applicable
 <workmad3>  Gamah: and how long would it take you to compute that rainbow
             table?
     <sbrg>  by your logic, I can solve any problem that way.
     <sbrg>  i can just create a database of all sorted lists.
    <Gamah>  sure...
     <sbrg>  .. just like i can create a database of all sudokus. if we
             fix n, then yes, it is bounded and you can just solve it in
             constant time.
  <kadoban>  sbrg: Well, not really, you still have lookup time.
  <kadoban>  Oh, for fixed n I guess that doesn't matter.
     <sbrg>  constant time where a unit is defined to be the lookup time
     <sbrg>  there you go!
    <Gamah>  workmad3: that would depend on how well i could optimize the
             verification algo
     <sbrg>  it's all about context
 <workmad3>  sbrg: well, you can solve it in constant time, assuming the
             existence of an oracle :)
    <Gamah>  the $1m question just says "a computer" and "in polynomial
             time"
    <Gamah>  it doesn't say i can't spend years precomputing the search
             space
    <Gamah>  :)
     <sbrg>  i don't think you understand what P vs NP means
 <workmad3>  Gamah: assuming the existence of an oracle is generally not
             classed as a solution to P vs NP
    <Gamah>  i thought the smiley implied i was being pedantic
 <workmad3>  Gamah: otherwise it would have been solved years ago :P
    <Gamah>  workmad3: well i was just going to use oracle DB
    <Gamah>  :)

     <jkbbwr>  Im aiming to implement a chunk of a runtime and maybe a

 <FManTropyx>  my apartment badly needs garbage collection (hi, btw)
      <liste>  FManTropyx: no-op garbage collector's an option :)
       <adsc>  you could add some rats, they take care of the organic
               garbage
       <adsc>  or rather, they compound multiple types of organic garbage
               into a single type
   <workmad3>  adsc: and then add some cats to convert the rat problem
               into an extra type?
       <adsc>  which rat problem?
   <workmad3>  adsc: the rat problem caused by introducing rats to solve
               your garbage problem :P
       <adsc>  rats are a problem?
       <adsc>  hmmm
       <adsc>  yes, it seems one cat per 5 rats should solve any "rat
               problems"
       <wedr>  So, you're saying for those who live near a farm, they need
               to get 65 cats?
       <adsc>  yes
       <adsc>  although I guess it doesn't scale up linearly
    <rindolf>  heh
       <adsc>  each additional cat probably raises the number of total
               rats that can be dealt with
       <adsc>  so two cats might be able to deal with more than 10 rats
    <rindolf>  poor rats
       <adsc>  also you should make sure the cats are neutered, or you
               will soon have to introduce dogs to solve a cat problem

       <wedr>  5 cats -> 60+ rats killed.

        <Zajt>  Hello! Is this UML diagram
                https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/sm4frpobsubifu6j6jv8 a
                correct example of the factory method design pattern?
     <rindolf>  Zajt: is this homework?
        <Zajt>  rindolf kind of, it's from school work but the purpose is
                not to make an UML diagra. I just try to explain the
                pattern by making this figure, but needs to be sure that
                it's correct so I don't miss anything in it
     <rindolf>  Zajt: ah
     <rindolf>  Zajt: it figures that it is schoolwork
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  UML's main purpose is to keep CS profs employed and
                students busy
     <rindolf>  SPEEDRAC1ST: heh
        <iawc>  Though the profs still suffer a concaussion when doing
                both at the same time.
        <Zajt>  rindolf what do you mean?
     <rindolf>  Zajt: UML and Design Patterns are not oof much interest
                elsewhere
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  design patterns became a buzzword recently
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  also, "anti-pattern"
        <Zajt>  yeah but did you read what I wrote above? I do it for a
                report in school so I have not an exercise that says
                "Write this UML-diagram", but I have done it myself just
                to illustrate the problem. But I want to make sure it's
                correct what I have done
      <Groogy>  design patterns and anti-pattern are super old buzzwords
      <Groogy>  what do you mean recently
      <Groogy>  the last 30 years?
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  recently there was a resurgence of those
      <Groogy>  lol okay
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  "we're kewl, we use JavaScript design patterns"
      <Groogy>  Designu-patteru-jutsu
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  are you a pattern-ninja?
      <Groogy>  HAI!
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  then join our innovative revolutionary startup which has
                lots of hype and VC monies
      <Groogy>  Actually I think it is good to read about design patterns
                and anti-patterns, to just have in back of your mind. But
                to actively try and "apply" the "molds" is not really the
                intent of it
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  some of those are neat. the ones that are about complexity
                management, and organization
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  but most are barely necessary
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  but overall, WTF would one need design patterns to make
                yet another web app?

 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  it's about to disrupt at least 3 industries

 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  PlanckWalk: none of them are functional, since an emulator
                is required to run one

     <rindolf>  here kwin_x11 consumes more RAM than firefox - no idea why
    <xssposed>  theres an extension that counteracts chromes hunger for
                ram. i forget the name of it, but it saves 90%
      <merijn>  Chrome's memory usage is increased a bit by the fact that
                it uses 1 process per tab, but it's not that drastic. Most
                of the gross memory usage that people blame on Chrome is
                just really "websites being shitty in the 2010s"

 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  JS's scope pisses me off the most. something as simple as

                don't have a common API :)
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  merijn: he proposed to use Scheme, Netscape said "no way".
                Then he decided to prank them with JS. and now we're
                paying for it
        <ongy>  rindolf: still a file, so I can't access /home/ongy
        <ongy>  merijn: because I wanted to direct an output directory to
                /dev/null before and it didn't work
        <okuu>  merijn: At least I'm allowed (in fact, required) to make
                sense.
      <merijn>  okuu: Trying to make my library play nicely with pipes,
                conduits, and just regular old forM/mapM...it's...tricky
                :p
     <rindolf>  SPEEDRAC1ST: it needed to resemble Java
      <merijn>  ongy: I don't quite understand what "copying to /dev/null"
                is supposed to do, though?
     <rindolf>  merijn: oooh - buzzwords
       <mniip>  but those are words
      <merijn>  rindolf: Hmm?
        <ongy>  merijn: why are you doing that? is it something you want
                others to use?
     <rindolf>  merijn: "pipes", "conduits"
        <okuu>  rindolf: Haskell plumbling libraries.
      <merijn>  rindolf: They are haskell libraries :)
        <ongy>  merijn: ignore all output that should be written there.
                sometimes I need that
      <merijn>  ongy: Because I use a mix of pipes and conduits in
                different projects and I find myself reinventing the same
                boilerplate
      <merijn>  ongy: And I wanna be done with it once and for all
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  I've learned about Cloud Haskell a few months ago
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  I guess they chose the name for marketing reasons
       <mniip>  merijn, that "once and for all" bit sounds unconvinving
        <okuu>  rindolf: Basically, so that you can replace “going crazy
                debugging” with “doing crazy with types” when doing stream
                processing. Although the “going crazy debugging” is
                sometimes not completely avoided.
      <merijn>  mniip: Why?
     <rindolf>  okuu: heh, sounds nasty
        <okuu>  rindolf: Yeah, but it's how Haskellers think.
     <rindolf>  okuu: haskellers are crazy?
        <okuu>  rindolf: Everyone is crazy in their own way.
       <mniip>  I must say haskell debugging sucks
     <rindolf>  okuu: true
        <iawc>  okuu: Haskell is just an API for common structures.
       <mniip>  why does everyone try to mimic imperative program
                debugging
      <merijn>  okuu: To be fair, conduits/pipes DO make some tasks that
                are really obnoxious in other languages really nice
        <iawc>  Or is that Ruby?
       <mniip>  functional semantics need to reflect respectively in the
                debugger
        <iawc>  They seem the same in a way.
   <rockman37>  iawc: Ruby and Haskell?
      <merijn>  rindolf: Basically, they abstract over "I want to stream
                process data from a pipe/socket/file/whatever in constant
                memory"
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  sounds like a job for a queue
        <okuu>  merijn: Then it turns out you want to backtrack, and
                everything goes to hell.
     <rindolf>  rockman37: reminds me of that guy who said Visual Basic
                was essentially the same as C++
      <merijn>  okuu: So, don't do that then :)
      <merijn>  okuu: I have plenty of cases where I don't need that
      <merijn>  okuu: If you need backtracking, use STM or something
        <okuu>  merijn: I have to admit, when you don't need to backtrack,
                pipes and conduit are very nice.
     <rindolf>  rockman37: and then went on to try to create a lossless
                audio compression that could compress a 40 MB WAV file
                into 20 kB
   <rockman37>  rindolf: Well, I wouldn't touch either :p
      <merijn>  SPEEDRAC1ST: Yeah, except that all the annoying bits of
                getting data, putting them in queues, adapting your code
                to read from them, etc. has all been done for you
   <rockman37>  rindolf: Lossless?
       <mniip>  something something yoctoparsec
     <rindolf>  rockman37: yes
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  merijn: by the corresponding librarires?
      <merijn>  SPEEDRAC1ST: They're basically a bunch of tools for
                turning stuff like a parser for a single object you wrote
                into one that gets fed data on demands and output an
                object every time it finishes (with further tools to
                incrementally process those)
      <merijn>  SPEEDRAC1ST: It's not earth-shattering rocket science.
                It's just a bunch of really convenient tools that I
                haven't found an adequate replacement for in other
                languages
        <okuu>  merijn: Probably because they aren't conveniently
                expressible in other languages. :-p
       <mniip>  everything is possible when you have programmable
                semicolons
     <rindolf>  rockman37: i think he was the one who was going on about
                that Planet Source Code thingy
        <okuu>  SPEEDRAC1ST: Think iterators on steroids.
 <SPEEDRAC1ST>  merijn: ok. I haven't had that exactly problem, but if I
                had I'd use something like Elixir's GenStage
   <rockman37>  Programmable semicolons sound nasty.
   <rockman37>  rindolf: Haven't heard of that.
       <mniip>  rockman37, ish, perl does that all the time
   <rockman37>  "4.3 million lines of source code examples and apps to
                build from." Hmm...
   <rockman37>  mniip: Interesting.
        <iawc>  howdy do dat?
       <mniip>  anyway, I remotely remember someone saying that monads
                (their do-block syntax specifically) are just programmable
                semicolons
     <rindolf>  rockman37: under a contradictory licence
   <rockman37>  rindolf: Serves users right, I say.

       <AbleBacon>  oh my god this law of demeter is exactly the opposite
                    of what we're doing
 <patientplatypus>  does anyone know how to programmatically create a
                    subtable in postgres?
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: not off hand
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: is there an sql syntax for that?
         <rindolf>  AbleBacon: heh
          <GeDaMo>  Would a subtable be like a view?
 <patientplatypus>  errr....
 <patientplatypus>  i want to basically make a tree of tables
 <patientplatypus>  like a json object
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: sound like it would stand against the
                    normalisation rules
       <AbleBacon>  what urge would possess you to make something as evil
                    as a tree of tables?
       <AbleBacon>  i understand the desire to do something to see if it
                    can be done, but us mortals should not meddle in the
                    workings of sorcery
 <patientplatypus>  im making dnd in sql
          <GeDaMo>  You might want to look up Common Table Expressions
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: the game?
 <patientplatypus>  yeah
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: ah
 <patientplatypus>  its a challenging problem
       <AbleBacon>  LOL i'm picturing players taking their turns by
                    submitting database queries with their requests
 <patientplatypus>  but it would be useful to be able to use a tree
                    structure
 <patientplatypus>  im just making the game sheet
          <GeDaMo>  There's at least one game like that
 <patientplatypus>  if i get that working that would be a hat trick
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: you can encode trees using a table or
                    two
 <patientplatypus>  hmmm
       <AbleBacon>  ADD "MOVE, 1" TO TABLE "MOVE_QUEUE_$PLAYER_NAME"
          <GeDaMo>  AbleBacon: https://schemaverse.com/
       <AbleBacon>  i always feel like SQL people are screaming
 <patientplatypus>  AHHHHH
       <AbleBacon>  "Compete against other players using raw SQL commands
                    to command your fleet." picard never had to do this
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus:
                    https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sql+tree&ia=qa
       <AbleBacon>  "CAPTAIN, we've lost control of our primary command

       <AbleBacon>  "... number one, give the order to abandon ship."
         <rindolf>  AbleBacon: heh
 <patientplatypus>  i may just use lots of tables without the tree - looks
                    overly complicated
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: what?
          <GeDaMo>  Why do you need trees of tables?
 <patientplatypus>  oh well....i was thinking trees but it just looks like
                    this would be sort of sucky
       <Myrl-saki>  AbleBacon: I'd be screaming too if I had to write SQL
                    for a living.
         <rindolf>  patientplatypus: every purpose should have a single
                    table

     <CashDash123>  How is a game like flappy bird ported to so many
                    systems?
     <CashDash123>  I mean what makes it so easy to port?
     <CashDash123>  I mean it's been ported to the snes,gba,etc
       <AbleBacon>  "captain, our systems are down! we can only match
                    enemy ships for targeting using regex!" "... number
                    one, issue the command ".*"" "but sir there are civi-"
                    "i give up"
        <jrslepak>  CashDash123: how complex is the game itself?
     <CashDash123>  no very jrslepak but how was the source code obtained
                    or was it reverse engineered?
       <AbleBacon>  CashDash123, the logic behind the game is very simple.
                    if it was written in, say, C++ there's probably a C++
                    compiler for all of those systems. the only thing that
                    would change really is how to display the graphics
       <AbleBacon>  ah--birds were the key to the game's breakthrough into
                    success i see
       <AbleBacon>  unless the birds are just a RED HERRING!
       <AbleBacon>  wait--is a herring a fish?
       <AbleBacon>  or a bird?
           <wedr_>  Yeah, the Inverse Laws of Game Design, the shorter the
                    jump distance, the more popular it gets via word of
                    mouth
     <CashDash123>  AbleBacon, the addiction of beating a highscore lead
                    to its popularity
           <wedr_>  herring is a fish yes
           <wedr_>  a type of tuna
         <rindolf>  AbleBacon: heh
           <wedr_>  salmon, not tuna
       <AbleBacon>  then we need to invent "flappy herring"
       <AbleBacon>  avoid sharks and other sea creatures idk
           <wedr_>  For a warning, I think it's called red harring.
           <wedr_>  Or haerring
       <AbleBacon>  no, "red flag" is a warning. "red herring" is
                    something that distracts you from the real thing
       <AbleBacon>  shoot i don't know anymore
           <wedr_>  red herring is a fish.
           <wedr_>  :/
           <wedr_>  red Sirens, maybe?
        <jrslepak>  it's also an idiom whose meaning is as AbleBacon
                    described
           <wedr_>  In Norse mythology, Sirens are blue.
           <wedr_>  Or was it Greek?
           <wedr_>  So red Sirens is like the shiny Pokemon that distracts
                    you in real life.
       <AbleBacon>  all those poor kids getting hit by cars looking at
                    their phones hunting for pokemon
           <wedr_>  True, Pokemon Go caused kids to get hit more often
        <jrslepak>  the best solution is to play it on the bus :-P
       <AbleBacon>  you don't want to go on the bus in america
       <AbleBacon>  it is not a nice place
        <jrslepak>  I was just there a few hours ago
          <GeDaMo>  Does America only have one bus? :|
        <jrslepak>  haha
        <jrslepak>  it seems that way some evenings
     <CashDash123>  Leads me to question of how were games ported back in
                    the day when you would have to downgrade a game to run
                    on a system?
          <GeDaMo>  A lot of hard work
     <CashDash123>  kinda like how lets say you have developed a dreamcast
                    game while also having a linux and windows port
     <CashDash123>  how does that work or even in reverse
          <GeDaMo>  The game engine may have to be partly rewritten but
                    the content (graphics etc.) should be reusable
     <CashDash123>  I mean I was thinking in a similar vain to Elysian
                    Shadows which I'm pretty sure was designed around the
                    dreamcast
     <CashDash123>  Which was tweaked most likey
     <CashDash123>  that or I may also get an Idea by reading quora
          <GeDaMo>  Hmmm ... there's a #dreamcastdev channel
      <horny-sama>  GeDaMo: I thought dreamcast was stuff before I was
                    born. Surprised that people still dev for it
          <GeDaMo>  There's a also an #elysian_shadows channel but only
                    one person in it
          <GeDaMo>  People still develop for a lot of old systems
     <CashDash123>  It's been chronicled on youtube since they were in
                    high school in 2007
     <CashDash123>  horny-sama, The Dreamcast due to it's discontinuation
                    date makes it more common to have a system without
                    protection from playing burned cdr's though it's bad
                    for the laser
       <AbleBacon>  "bad for the laser"--a likely story
 <patientplatypus>  ok
 <patientplatypus>  im confused
     <CashDash123>  AbleBacon, well it was designed for GD-ROM
       <AbleBacon>  how could it damage the laser, though?
       <AbleBacon>  lasers don't have any moving parts!
 <patientplatypus>  so here's my question: if i have a table with a, b, c,
                    d, e and I want each of those 5 letters to reference 5
                    different tables A, B, C, D, E how would I do this in
                    postgresql? I can link tables by foreign/primary key
                    but I cant see how they actually reference the value
                    its linking to
 <patientplatypus>  so
          <GeDaMo>  Why do you have 5 different tables?
 <patientplatypus>  in dnd you have paladin, fighter, etc. I want each of
                    those items to link to a table that contains their
                    statistics. So one table with classnames, several
                    linked tables with different statistics
          <grouse>  GeDaMo, gotta have redundant table in case bobby drops
                    them ;)
          <GeDaMo>  Why can't this be in one table?
       <AbleBacon>  all classes have strength, intelligence, etc. you
                    should have one table for shared characteristics of
                    all classes
 <patientplatypus>  because each class is entirely different from another
       <AbleBacon>  oh i see what you're saying
 <patientplatypus>  well like wizard and fighter are so different that the
                    tables need to be totally separate
 <patientplatypus>  the way sql seems to want to work is that it just
                    replicates tables in a single customer/many purchases
                    type pattern
 <patientplatypus>  does anyone have any suggestions? im totally lost and
                    have been staring at this for a while
          <GeDaMo>  I'm having difficulty visualising your DB structure
 <patientplatypus>  so one table for classes (fighter, wizard, etc)
 <patientplatypus>  each class will have its one table - fighter table,
                    wizard table, paladin table
 <patientplatypus>  with their own special statistics on each
          <GeDaMo>  What fields do these tables have?
 <patientplatypus>  each table will have entirely different fields (this
                    is the problem- if they were similar it would not be
                    an issue). so fighter has swords and fighting, and
                    wizard would have spells etc
 <patientplatypus>  i need what is essentially some sort of tree/json like
                    hiearchy but in sql
 <patientplatypus>  ltree seems very confusing
 <patientplatypus>  what do you mean beaky?
          <GeDaMo>  What do these tables represent? Are they like D&D
                    character sheets?
      <horny-sama>  CashDash123: gd-rom?
          <GeDaMo>  Yeah, IRC will do that to you :|
     <CashDash123>  horny-sama, It was Sega's specialized cd I think the
                    reason the burned cd exploit had to do something with
                    an exploit with the mil-cd format
     <CashDash123>  though
      <horny-sama>  Is it safe to assume that gd-rom is out of production
     <CashDash123>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD-ROM horny-sama
      <horny-sama>  CashDash123: did not say if it is out of production or
                    not
     <CashDash123>  I don't think anyone can press there games to GD-Rom
                    anymore.
     <CashDash123>  I don't acually even own a dreamcast I just learned
                    abit about it
     <CashDash123>  long ago
      <horny-sama>  good luck with whatever you are doing
      <horny-sama>  sounds cool
     <CashDash123>  I figured it out hombre is pressed to mil-cd's
            <xeno>  why would anyone wanna press things onto GD-Ros
                    anymore?
            <xeno>  or why am I asking?
     <CashDash123>  don't qoute me on that
     <CashDash123>  quote
      <horny-sama>  xeno: I think CashDash123 is doing some dreamcast dev
     <CashDash123>  horny-sama, I'm not
      <horny-sama>  CashDash123: so just quest for knowledge?
            <xeno>  horny-sama: yeah, but why?
     <CashDash123>  It would just be a good place to get an Idea of how a
                    game is ported
            <xeno>  horny-sama: it's like the worst waste of time
      <horny-sama>  xeno: different people have different hobby
            <xeno>  yeah I know
       <AbleBacon>  oh no... we're resorting to "scrum" meetings every
                    morning. things must be getting really desperate.
     <CashDash123>  I mean how games are made for old consoles really is
                    interesting
      <horny-sama>  AbleBacon: ?
       <AbleBacon>  at my work
       <AbleBacon>  and they pay me and all i have to do is not die
          <GeDaMo>  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Scrum-1.JPG
      <horny-sama>  AbleBacon: in other words, you are their basic bitch
     <CashDash123>  horny-sama, You could say that,and I really wanted a
                    dreamcast a long time ago
       <AbleBacon>  it's not a giant wrestling orgy; it's a management
                    technique
          <GeDaMo>  Why not both? :D
      <horny-sama>  AbleBacon: just hope you made your fuck you money soon
                    so you can quit
      <horny-sama>  lol
          <Rounin>  AbleBacon: Your team just needs to move their
                    organization to Sloth® so that all of their personal
                    data can be sold to advertisers
          <Rounin>  Then you'll be truly efficient
          <Rounin>  And of course SourceHub™ to organize your Packer
                    images

     <narupo>  hello
    <rindolf>  narupo: hi
    <rindolf>  narupo: how are you?
     <narupo>  rindolf: hi rindolf. I'm fine :)
    <rindolf>  narupo: nice
     <narupo>  rindolf: sup?
    <rindolf>  narupo: i'm fine - trying to be productive
    <rindolf>  narupo: i reached inbox ZERO nirvana
     <narupo>  rindolf: hm
     <narupo>  rindolf: inbox is mail box?
    <rindolf>  narupo: the email
               https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in-box#English
    <Xatenev>  rindolf, wait, you cna be productive while being in irc?
     <narupo>  rindolf: thanks.
     <narupo>  rindolf: what is "ZERO nirvana"?
      <wXeno>  rindolf: inbox zero?! wtf?
    <rindolf>  narupo: an empty inbox
    <rindolf>  narupo: and nirvana means a state of bliss
 <FManTropyx>  ah, I thought it was the penultimate opposite of nirvana
 <FManTropyx>  ie. zero nirvana
     <narupo>  rindolf: ah, thanks. nirvana :)
 <FManTropyx>  incidentally, my music collection is also ZERO nirvana
    <rindolf>  narupo: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana
    <rindolf>  wXeno: the fuck!
     <narupo>  my bank account is ZERO nirvana ;)
    <rindolf>  FManTropyx: ah
    <rindolf>  narupo: heh
    <rindolf>  FManTropyx: inbox zero's nirvana
      <wXeno>  rindolf: on one of mine I got 5.5gb of mails (maybe 10k in
               my inbox for the last year) - for the other one I don't
               know, but 2-3000 unread
    <rindolf>  the nirvana of inbox zero
    <rindolf>  wXeno: ouch
    <rindolf>  wXeno: i once saw a screenshot of a gmail.com account with
               130K unread messages in the inbox
    <rindolf>  wXeno: anyway, i hate clutter
      <wXeno>  if you don't tend to it, then that goes fast
      <wXeno>  rindolf: me too, but it's hard to avoid when I can get some
               hundreds of mails with actual content in an
               average/slightly busy day
      <wXeno>  rindolf: and enough of references and long running topics
               that I can't delete old mails without losing relevant info
    <rindolf>  wXeno: i move away emails to other folders
      <wXeno>  rindolf: me too
      <wXeno>  rindolf: and I delete what I can
    <rindolf>  wXeno: ah
    <rindolf>  wXeno: now i have an empty inbox in my gmail account too
      <wXeno>  rindolf: damn, how? you delete everything?
    <Xatenev>  I get like 4 emails per day.
    <Xatenev>  Heh
      <exio4>  I get about 4 emails I actually read a day too, and another
               40-60 with content I might or might not care about :P
    <rindolf>  wXeno: no
      <wXeno>  rindolf: you made a mail address which violates the SMTP
               protocol?
    <rindolf>  wXeno: no
      <wXeno>  rindolf: you made it 17 seconds ago, and miraculously
               google failed at sending the welcome mails?
      <wXeno>  rindolf: ah you moved them to another folder
      <wXeno>  all mails from *@* -> inbox2 doesn't count :)
    <rindolf>  wXeno: in this case i deleted them
    <rindolf>  wXeno: but i dont delete all emails
