             preprocessor attached. So I thought you would be the right
             people to ask about whether there is a way to make the
             submitted value on an <input type=submit> different from the
             visible label on the button.
   <yrlnry>  Thanks in advance.
          *  Roderick tars and feathers yrlnry.
   <yrlnry>  Hi, Roderick! How's the kid?
    <Somni>  you have been misinformed, sir; Perl is just a regex engine
             with named variables
   <ne2k__>  yrlnry: that is possibly one of the oddest questions I have
             ever heard
   <yrlnry>  ne2k__: What's odd about "How's the kid?"
   <yrlnry>  You need to get out more, seriously.
   <ne2k__>  yrlnry: I meant the original question
 <Roderick>  Congratulations, I hope it's going well.
   <yrlnry>  Do you know that Jewish folktale about the man who lives in a
             tiny hut with his wife and kids and they can't stand the
             crowding any more, so they go to the rabbi for advice, and
             the rabbit suggests that they bring the chickens, goat, and
             cow into the house too?
   <ne2k__>  yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the
             <input> tag in HTML has both "name" and "value" attributes.
             the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.
   <yrlnry>  ne2k__: yes, and the value is also what is submitted when
             someone presses the button, but I want the displayed label to
             be different from what it submitted, as it is say with

    <rindolf>  If you want a configuration file, you should be using
               something like INI, YAML, etc.
    <rindolf>  XML perhaps.
    <rindolf>  Something.
    <rindolf>  Apache-like config.
    <dazjorz>  Apache-like is very strong but hard to parse, right ?
    <dazjorz>  Loading and saving configuration never looks good,
               especially when it's XML
    <dazjorz>  the code to load and save is ugly.

 <LeoNerd>  I feel there must be a way to do this... given func( foo => 1,
            bar => 2 ); how to write my ( $foo, $bar ) = .... inside the
            function?
 <LeoNerd>  My current attempt is my ( $foo, $bar ) = @{{@_}}{qw( foo bar
            )}; which is messy as sin
    <icke>  LeoNerd: what's the problem? readability?
 <LeoNerd>  Yah
 <dazjorz>  LeoNerd: I'd change specs to be func({ foo => 1, bar => 2})
 <dazjorz>  then my ($foo, $bar) = ($_[0]{foo}, $_[0]{bar});
     <ton>  Leonerd: If you insist on doing it on one line, that's about
            as good as it gets. But why not use a temporary hash ? Should
            be just as fast and as readable
 <LeoNerd>  Hrm.. :/ Then it's only marginally nicer as my ( $foo, $bar )
            = @{$_[0]}{qw( foo bar )};
 <LeoNerd>  my %args = @_; my ( $foo, $bar ) = @args{qw( foo bar )}; ya...
            that works
     <mst>  LeoNerd: my ($foo, $bar) = do { my %a = @_; @a{qw(foo bar)} };
     <ton>  if you combine it with a delete you can then check if %args is
            empty and catch typos or unexpected arguments....
 <LeoNerd>  Oooh.. a do block
 <vincent>  or use padwalker
 <LeoNerd>  Oh, args won't be empty... this is a wrapper function that
            pulls a few named args off and sends the rest to a nested
            inner function
 <LeoNerd>  Now.. I want to call a function "foreach" but that breaks
            things... suggestions?
    <icke>  a method could be named 'foreach'
 <LeoNerd>  Ya.. but this is a plain function
    <icke>  tough
 <LeoNerd>  I suppose "iterate" is about as best as I'll get
    <icke>  for_each

       <Similian>  is there a smart way to read a file to a certain string

       <Similian>  which loop to use?
        <rindolf>  Similian: you can read it byte by byte.
        <rindolf>  Similian: do you want to read the whole thing?
       <Similian>  no
       <Similian>  too big 200 MB
 <simcop2387-lab>  reading bit by bit is usually not supported by most

       <danieldg>  ik: that would be a zero-bit processor then
             <ik>  no no
       <danieldg>  half-bit processor stores 0's or sqrt(2)'s
             <ik>  sqrt(2) may as well be 1
 <simcop2387-lab>  rindolf: a 1 bit processor would be a hell of a thing
                   to work with

             <ik>  We're not talking about numbers, we're talking about on
                   and off, true and false, whatever you want to call it
             <ik>  sqrt(2) is nonzero, so it's one.
        <rindolf>  danieldg: not 1/sqrt(2)?
       <danieldg>  hmm it would probably be that, yes
 <simcop2387-lab>  my proc uses sqrt[-1]!

     <rindolf>  My father and I joked about sorting the dishes in the
                dishwasher.
     <rindolf>  My father said: "If you won't sort the dishwasher, the
                dishwasher won't be sorted."
      <Loci64>  rindolf: bubble sort *g*
        <icke>  dishsort
     <rindolf>  Then I said "No, it won't be sorted by me."
     <rindolf>  So he said "No, it won't be sorted at all. We will throw
                the dishwasher."
     <rindolf>  "Along with all the dishes."
     <rindolf>  Loci64: bubble sort is inefficient.
     <rindolf>  Loci64: you should use quicksort or mergesort.
     <whoppix>  or bashsort, or heapsort!
        <icke>  yeah, but thorough.
     <rindolf>  Loci64: or for small values of "N" - insertion sort.
     <whoppix>  although I can't remember if those were stable.
     <rindolf>  whoppix: what is bashsort?
        <icke>  that matters for a dishwasher
 <EvanCarroll>  /bin/sort
 <EvanCarroll>  duh
      <Loci64>  hehe, but dishwashers usually have medium to large numbers
                of N ;-) maybe trashsort solves the problem
     <rindolf>  EvanCarroll: perldoc -f sort is more portable.
     <whoppix>  rindolf, shellsort, not bashsort, sorry :)
     <rindolf>  But I'll need to build a robot to use it with the dishes.
        <icke>  cshsort
 <EvanCarroll>  here must be a trillion sorting algos
 <EvanCarroll>  and 9/10 of them are total shit
 <EvanCarroll>  and inferior in every way.
 <EvanCarroll>  This sorting algorithem is coveted if you KNOW that only
                one value is out of perfect order and it sits in the

  <markl_>  so while i'm on the subject, is there a good perl HTML
            framework similar to what CakePHP is to PHP ?
  <markl_>  like an MVC style environment
  <markl_>  so i'm wondering if mason is "state of the art" or if there
            are other tools to consider these days :)
  <DrForr>  Catalyst.
  <markl_>  catalyst ok, cool ty
 <rindolf>  markl_: there are plenty of other web-devel frameworks.
 <rindolf>  perlbot: web frameworks
 <perlbot>  rindolf: CGI-Application (and Titanium), CGI-Application-Plus,
            CGI-Builder, CGI-Prototype, Jifty, Catalyst (and Reaction),
            Mojo, SweetPea, Dancer, Gantry, AxKit, WebGUI
  <markl_>  rindolf: hmm, way too many it would appear :)
 <rindolf>  markl_: yeah.
  <markl_>  what are the easiest ones for people good with perl but not
            HTML/CSS/AJAX experts ?
 <rindolf>  markl_: not that Ruby or PHP have fewer.
  <markl_>  or the most widely adopted one ?
 <rindolf>  markl_: the most popular appears to be Catalyst.
  <markl_>  catalyst seems to at least have a book :)
 <rindolf>  markl_: it has several books.
 <rindolf>  markl_: I worked a bit with Mojolicious, and it wasn't too
            bad, but it reinvents a lot of wheels.
 <rindolf>  Due to its philosophy.
 <rindolf>  markl_: I also did some Catalyst projects.
 <rindolf>  Catalyst is a bit complicated.
 <rindolf>  sawyer: can you comment about Dancer?
  <sawyer>  Dancer is a lightweight web framework, it aims to make website

             netiquette.
  <mutewit>  But by the time I came back to the channel there was a whole
             page of "preaching".
  <mutewit>  I was using a split method with array indexing and it felt
             too much like a C-approach.
  <rindolf>  mutewit: oh, you split the string into chars?
      <mst>  yeah, by the time you've done map, join, split, ...
      <mst>  you've basically just reimplemented substr badly :)
  <mutewit>  rindolf: That's what I was doing, but the map/substr approach
             is a lot cleaner.
  <rindolf>  mutewit: yeah/
  <rindolf>  mutewit: split into chars sometimes has some uses.
  <rindolf>  mutewit: but this reminds me too much of SICP.
  <rindolf>  perlbot: sicp
  <perlbot>  rindolf: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ - "Structure and
             Interpretation of Computer Programs" - A Classical Text on

  <rindolf>  mutewit: see -
             http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide13.html
  <rindolf>  mutewit: this is how an SICP programmer will implement a
             simple text processing task.
  <mutewit>  SICP, love the book.
  <mutewit>  and all the OCaml work this year has given rise to a
             functional bent of mind
  <mutewit>  which is kinda screwing around with my perl code.
  <rindolf>  mutewit: yeah.
  <rindolf>  mutewit:
             http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide12.html
             - this is the fastest Perl solution.
  <rindolf>  At least in speed.
  <rindolf>  It can be a little shorter with a regex lookahead, but it's
             less elegant and slower.
  <rindolf>  http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide9.html
             - there you go.
  <rindolf>  mutewit: did you know how to program before reading SICP?
  <rindolf>  I think it's not a good introductory book.
  <rindolf>  MIT are going to ditch it in favour of some Python/Robotics
             curriculum.
      <mst>  I think it's only a good introductory book if you know some
             math and have the brain to follow it
      <mst>  it teaches a lot of hard concepts very quickly
  <Su-Shee>  mst: from a "I'm from the humanities department" point of
             view it's managable. it's not easy, but everyone can work
             with it.

          *  rindolf slaps tybalt89 with mst's slipper for golfing
             mutewit's solution and telling him it's a good idea.
 <tybalt89>  rindolf: that's not golfing, just common simple regex :)
  <rindolf>  tybalt89: sigh.
  <rindolf>  tybalt89: simple.
  <rindolf>  irregular regular expression.
  <rindolf>  Maybe use Regexp::Common
  <mutewit>  I added in tybalt89's code but commented it for future
             reference.
      <mst>  I'd definitely use the substr approach for real code
      <mst>  tybalt89's code is cleverness to prove it can be done; I
             don't believe he was recommending it
 <tybalt89>  mst: sigh, yes, I am recommending it. It's the clearest
             solution.
      <mst>  tybalt89: I respectfully disagree.
      <mst>  I find the substr approach far more obvious
    <Chazz>  rindolf, ty. :)
      <mst>  but then, I mostly write applications perl rather than
             scripts, so I only engage in regexp cleverness when actively
             useful
  <rindolf>  tybalt89: look-aheads and look-behinds are dark corners of
             the Perl not-so-reg-regexes
   <Yaakov>  In the context of this particular problem, it's pretty
             straightforward, but, knowledge of the
             development/maintenance team(s) would push my choce one way
             or another.
 <tybalt89>  mst: note it took rindolf three tries, and even then he got
             it wrong.
  <rindolf>  tybalt89: well, I'm not focused now.
      <mst>  tybalt89: map substr($str, $_, 5), 0 .. length($str)-5; ?
      <mst>  maybe -6
          *  tybalt89 turns the lens, trying to focus rindolf
  <rindolf>  mst: -5
      <mst>  but it's hardly difficult; rindolf's just having a day of
             silly mistakes
  <rindolf>  Unit tests!
      <mst>  I'd expect him to get it right first time when on form too :)
  <rindolf>  Some clear code is hard to get right.
  <rindolf>  Doesn't make it less clear.
      <mst>  yeah
  <rindolf>  Most people will not write a correct binary search at first
             try.
 <tybalt89>  "maybe -6" is proof of unclearness :)
  <rindolf>  But the correct binary search is easy to digest.
      <mst>  tybalt89: no, it's proof it's 8pm on a sunday and I'm not
             particularly awake either
      <mst>  but your code just made me go "hang on, WHAT?!"
      <mst>  then I had to stop and dissect it
      <mst>  -then- I saw what you were doing
  <rindolf>  mst++
      <mst>  also, the substr approach displays the semantics and the
             reasoning
      <mst>  whereas the regex approach displays, well, line noise,
             frankly
  <rindolf>  mst: why don't we agree to disagree with tybalt89 ?

   <sdgvf>  most people, even if they know what N.B. stands for, aren't
            going to note it a whole lot harder than if it just says Note:
 <rindolf>  Bikeshedding.
 <rindolf>  PerlJam: according to Zaba's wikipedia link, it should not be
            capitalised.
 <Su-Shee>  what it's for nota bene?
 <PerlJam>  rindolf: My reading of the article is inconclusive as to what
            it "should" be. It seems to all depend on who's manual of
            style you subscribe to.
 <^Mike\b>  Su-Shee: yes
 <Su-Shee>  if a real sentence which could stand for its own follows, I
            start with a capital letter. if not, I don't.
  <talexb>  By the way: Don't forget what colour you'd like the bike shed
            painted.
 <PerlJam>  talexb: "color" ;->
  <talexb>  Pffffffft. ;)
 <LeoNerd>  Wait.. we're -painting- the bikeshed now? Nobody ever
            mentioned paint before...
  <talexb>  LeoNerd And you're head of the committee to choose the new
            COLOUR.
 <Su-Shee>  "first we choose the color, then we choose the paint." (from
            my english teacher at school.. :)
 <LeoNerd>  $ perl -MConvert::Color -E'say
            Convert::Color->new("bikeshed")->as_rgb->rgb' => Unable to
            parse color name bikeshed at -e line 1
  <kent\n>  doesn't the paint type preclude the colour choice? and paint
            manufacturer?
 <LeoNerd>  Hehe.. Now we're arguing about the process of bikeshedding..
            Go meta :)
  <kent\n>  LeoNerd: you read my mind
  <kent\n>  and now I mention that, were' metameta something
  <talexb>  Taking things a *little* too literally.
 <Su-Shee>  kent\n: it's a lesson to illustrate that color and paint are
            two different things...
 <LeoNerd>  Colour is very complex problem...
 <LeoNerd>  A lot of computer-type techies think it's just an RGB triplet,
            or maybe a triplet in some other space...
  <talexb>  And anyway, Google's just patented the primary colours in
            their logo. But mauve is still available. For good reason.
 <Su-Shee>  LeoNerd: luckily, I've learned "color" by actual "paint". ;)
  <kent\n>  Yeah, it matters about whats in the proximity of the bikeshed,
            perceptual colour :(
    <anno>  German uses the same word for color and paint, so we need to
            be taught the difference
    <anno>  same with shadow and shade
         *  LeoNerd takes anno out back to "teach him a lesson"
 <Su-Shee>  anno: excellent example. same with freedom and liberty.
         *  kent\n wonders if the bikeshed has to be colourblind safe
         *  talexb wonders what colour a duck blind is. Oh. Camoflage.
            Never mind.
 <Su-Shee>  camouflage. you've just introduced french into the discussion
            ;)
  <kent\n>  talexb: what colours are blind ducks painted though?
  <kent\n>  wait till we start painting our words, bikeshed synaesthesia
            sounds like a win.

 <designerjean>  http://scsys.co.uk:8002/87521
 <designerjean>  i know i'm not supposed to be using XML::Simple
 <designerjean>  but it's only one statement in the program
      <rindolf>  designerjean: is it causing problems?
          <mst>  yes, and it's the one that makes the $config you can't
                 work out how to use
 <designerjean>  maybe
      <rindolf>  mst: :-)
          <mst>  your exact problem is "unable to use the results of
                 XML::Simple"
          <mst>  because you're stupid and XML::Simple is shit
          <mst>  please switch to XML::Twig
 <designerjean>  ok thanks
        <dhoss>  people still use xml?
      <rindolf>  dhoss: it's a dirty job, but it pays.
        <dhoss>  i guess there's that
 <designerjean>  another case of stupid youth
        <dhoss>  designerjean: how old are you
      <rindolf>  dhoss: well, I'm using XML for some stuff willingly.
      <rindolf>  dhoss: JSON wouldn't have been usable.
        <dhoss>  rindolf: i guess that's a legit reason
      <rindolf>  Because I use them for text and stuff like that.
      <rindolf>  And it's hard to do something like <p>Hello
                 <b>dhoss</b>!</p> in JSON.
     <rokoteko>  I think its mainly amongst web programmers where JSON is
                 appreciated the most.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: JSON has many valid uses.
      <DuClare>  XML has none
      <LeoNerd>  XML is for putting attribute markup within a stream of
                 text.
        <dhoss>  rindolf: yea i can see that. json is more useful in a
                 cross language barrier bit where markup isn't needed
      <LeoNerd>  (mostly because it came out of SGML)
      <rindolf>  DuClare: not true.
     <rokoteko>  XML is very widely used. that's like saying "I dont need
                 to know Java, because the language sucks" ..
      <Su-Shee>  rindolf: you're mixing semantics with style here anyways.
                 that would be bad xml.
      <rindolf>  Su-Shee: I was giving an illustrative example.
      <Su-Shee>  rindolf: then give a proper one. that was exactly how NOT
                 to XML.
      <rindolf>  Su-Shee: besides , I think that <b> has some valid,
                 semantic meaning.
      <rindolf>  And it's also shorter than <strong></strong>
      <rindolf>  Su-Shee: ok.
      <Su-Shee>  rindolf: no. bold doesn't mean "be bold and courageous
                 here". it means "print this shit in bold typeface"
      <rindolf>  <p>Hello <name>Su-Shee</name>!</p>
      <rindolf>  XML is useful for wrapping and annotating text.
      <Dorward>  XML is only useful for wrapping and annotating text if
                 you use a properly designed application of XML and
                 everyone reading the document agrees on what the meaning
                 is.
     <rokoteko>  XTML vs XDML could derive from XML. (text and data
                 respectively). then of course you should be able to embed
                 XDML in XTML.
     <rokoteko>  oh wait. Im thinkin aloud.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: I've recently played with an XML-specific
                 compression tool.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: it achieved better compression than xz -9
                 --extreme but OTOH mishandled some «"» not inside
                 attributes - converting them to &quot;
     <rokoteko>  rindolf: what requirements are you trying to meet by
                 compressing xml?
      <PerlJam>  smaller XML docs :)
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: well, to reduce the size.
     <rokoteko>  well, doh. but why?
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: like over the Net, etc.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: it's like gzip compression/decompression.
     <rokoteko>  rindolf: I yet fail to see the point. :(
      <rindolf>  Only domain-specific.
     <rokoteko>  why?
      <rindolf>  And if you have a lot of it it occupies less on the hard
                 disk.
     <rokoteko>  Ah. you have like SHITLOADS of XML ?
      <rindolf>  It could happen.
      <rindolf>  Java...
      <PerlJam>  anyone who deals with XML probably has that much ;)
     <rokoteko>  Well, disk is pretty cheap.
      <rindolf>  I don't have too much XML.
      <rindolf>  Well, maybe a lot of XHTML.
     <rokoteko>  I was just curious about rindolf's use case.
     <rokoteko>  I was afraid that he was storing some binary data in XML.
                 :)
          <mst>  I think he was just experimenting with technology
      <rindolf>  Yes, I probably have more disk wasted on .mp3's and
                 .flv's.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: I have some interest in compression methods.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: back from high school.
     <rokoteko>  rindolf: :)
      <Su-Shee>  if you're the company who's transferring 120 years of
                 documents of a car company into something flexible - THEN
                 you have a shitload of XML.
      <rindolf>  There have been some recent advancements.
     <rokoteko>  So just out of curiousity, that's fine with me. :) Im
                 just nosy sometimes.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: I think the wikipedia XML dump is pretty large.
          <mst>  I find it's usually safe to assume that whatver rindolf's
                 doing, there isn't a good reason for it.
      <rindolf>  rokoteko: there was some stuff about processing it
                 quickly using Perl, etc.
      <rindolf>  mst: :-)
      <rindolf>  mst++ # Nice burn.
      <Su-Shee>  popcorn anyone? ;)
      <rindolf>  mst: but it has a huge grain of truth in it I admit.
      <rindolf>  Su-Shee: microwave popcorn?
      <Su-Shee>  I don't have a microwave and I was being sarcastic...
      <Su-Shee>  I need a smiley for that.
      <rindolf>  Su-Shee: ah.
      <Su-Shee>  rindolf-shaped, obviously.
      <rindolf>  Su-Shee: yes, I was playing along.

              *  rindolf prepares some popcorn and shares it with Su-Shee
                 using the Popcorn-over-IRC protocol.
       <DrForr>  What's this about burnt popcorn?
      <rindolf>  Popcorn-over-IRC also preserves the butter taste.
 <burnedcelery>  you're getting my keyboard all greasy
      <apeiron>  ew, butter
      <rindolf>  And it also supports multicasting popcorn.
      <PerlJam>  butter++

    <rp21>  i think i'm too critical to be a programmer ...

Question: how can I switch off my TV?

What he wants to hear? For example: Locate on/off button your TV remote a
press it. The button is usually red and located at the topmost line on the
remote.

The #perl expert's answer: First, what do you mean with "switch off"? Define
it first. Nopaste your TV, TV remote and the living room too.

After a nopaste:

Your room is ugly. And the TV looks terrible. Use [Mr.
Clean](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Clean) on the screen and clean your
living room first. Use three cleaning mops instead of two. Use HDMI and never
use scart (?) connectors, unless you really want to. Your TV remote has
unreadable buttons, clean up first. You're a beginner, so read:

 <GordonFreeman>  grep: lookbehind assertion is not fixed length
       <rindolf>  GordonFreeman: grep is PCRE - it's not Perl.
       <rindolf>  perlbot: pcre
       <Altreus>  GordonFreeman: don't use regex for HTML
       <perlbot>  rindolf: PCRE is not Perl. It lacks several features of
                  Perl regexes. Don't bother asking for help with a PCRE
                  pattern in a Perl channel as the answers will not be
                  relevant. Try #regex, or the channel for your language.
                  See also
                  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCRE#Differences_from_Perl
                  and LPBD.
 <GordonFreeman>  but this should work i think.
         <mauke>  no, it shouldn't
 <GordonFreeman>  though it fails at the second lookbehind ...
         <mauke>  no, it doesn't
 <GordonFreeman>  and fails at "* too

       <Altreus>  if you want perl regex use ack
       <Altreus>  surely
       <rindolf>  LeoNerd: sounds like programmers' hell.
          <anno>  perl regex doesn't support variable-length lookbehind
                  either
       <Altreus>  apeiron: actually it says it's highly experimental and
                  hence not working
       <Altreus>  it could well be Perl and not PCRE when finished :)
       <Altreus>  not that "perl regex" is a defined term, the speed Perl
                  is moving
        <yrlnry>  That's why you should never use Perl's builtin regexes.
                  Just write your own package, it's sure to be more
                  reliable.
       <rindolf>  yrlnry: :-)
        <talexb>  Heh.
       <LeoNerd>  use re::engine::vim;
       <rindolf>  yrlnry++
       <Altreus>  LeoNerd: is it core?
        <yrlnry>  HOP has a nice implementation. It works by generating a
                  list of every string matched by the regex, and looking
                  to see if your target string is in the list.
       <LeoNerd>  I can't help thinking that may not be optimal in terms
                  of CPU or memory usage
        <talexb>  yrlnry, no doubt they have a Cray working on generating
                  the list ..
        <yrlnry>  LeoNerd: Depends; unlike Perl regexes, it has no trouble
                  handling languages higher up the Chomsky hierarchy
        <yrlnry>  It is guaranteed to return the right answer for any
                  recursive language, and guaranteed to return correct
                  'matched' answers for any recursively enumerable
                  language.
       <LeoNerd>  Ohsure...
       <LeoNerd>  In terms of CS guarantees it's very nice
        <yrlnry>  So if you are in a big hurry to get the wrong answer...
       <LeoNerd>  But I live in the practical pragmatic world
       <LeoNerd>  E.g. Parser::MGC is horribly slow at backtracking and
                  whatnot, but I write parsers in it because those are
                  still fast for "reasonably" sized inputs, parsers are
                  fast to write, and I like having lots of side-effects
                  and dynamic logic -in- Perl
       <Altreus>  Unfortunately my universe doesn't have infinite
                  processing speeds and data storage
          <anno>  a universe with infinite processing speed would have
                  processed you by now
       <Altreus>  and
       <Altreus>  would have processed my grandchildren too
        <yrlnry>  This algorithm doesn' t need infinite speed or storage.
        <yrlnry>  It works slowly, but finitely.
       <Altreus>  what
        <yrlnry>  The infinite list is lazily generated and you never have
                  more than one of its elements in memory at any time.
       <rindolf>  yrlnry: is it sorted by length?
        <yrlnry>  You will learn this sort of technique after you have
                  been programming in Perl for eight months or so.
       <Altreus>  how do you know when it doesn't match
       <Altreus>  yrlnry: :D
        <yrlnry>  rindolf: it is sorted by length, and lexicographically
                  among strings of the same length.
       <rindolf>  yrlnry: ah.
        <yrlnry>  Of course, you cannot do the length-sorting thing for
                  arbitrary languages, but for regex languages there is no
                  trouble.
        <yrlnry>  http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/06InfiniteStreams.pdf
       <LeoNerd>  Eh..
       <LeoNerd>  I dunno. I just dislike purely RE-based parsing
       <LeoNerd>  I much prefer code doing it
 <GordonFreeman>  why can't perl regexp do variable length lookbehind
                  matching?
       <Altreus>  See originally I ignored you because it sounded like you
                  were talking shit
       <LeoNerd>  Limit of the implementation
       <Altreus>  mainly because it is possible to construct a regex with
                  an infinite range that nevertheless won't match a
                  particular string
          <anno>  GordonFreeman: who knows? looks like it's hard to
                  implement with the given engine
         <mauke>  GordonFreeman: unclear semantics and no one's bothered
                  to write the code
 <GordonFreeman>  i see
       <Altreus>  Plus, there's a fucking lot of unicode to create strings
                  out of
       <LeoNerd>  It's not "hard" to implement. It's impossible given the
                  algorithm being used
         <mauke>  LeoNerd: why impossible?
        <yrlnry>  LeoNerd: I don't think that's true. It could be done
                  using a recursive call to the regex engine now that that
                  is possible.
 <GordonFreeman>  but lookbehind is cool
       <LeoNerd>  Oooh.. yes.. I suppose it could do that now
 <GordonFreeman>  its like a reverse regexp that can be excluded
          <anno>  vim re's do it
       <LeoNerd>  vim uses a different type of engine
          <anno>  right
        <yrlnry>  Altreus: I was talking shit. After eight months you get
                  a license to do that.
         <mauke>  really?
       <Altreus>  yrlnry: but there's a pdf
        <yrlnry>  where's a PDF?
       <Altreus>  17:10 < yrlnry>
                  http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/06InfiniteStreams.pdf
        <yrlnry>  Yes.
       <Altreus>  I didn't open it or anything
         <mauke>  no one opens pdfs
        <yrlnry>  PDFs are for cowards and Slavs.
       <Altreus>  but it lent enough credence to your words that I decided
                  to believe your spurious claims
       <Altreus>  Actually someone did a test the other day
        <yrlnry>  Oh, does "talking shit" mean "making up nonsense"? Then
                  I was not talking shit.
       <Altreus>  He linked someone to articles supporting his viewpoint
                  and they changed their mind
        <yrlnry>  It is in section 6.5, "regex string generation".
       <Altreus>  but one of the articles was an argument against himself
       <Altreus>  Showing that it is enough to cite your sources to be
                  believed; not many people will actually bother to check
                  them
       <Altreus>  yrlnry: what do you normally think "talking shit" means?
       <Altreus>  are you confusing it with shooting the shit
        <yrlnry>  I'm not sure.
       <Altreus>  are you foreign

   <jozefk>  anybody with suggestion how can I clean up the code in the
             way as this tool is doing it temporarily in browser?
             http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7188/clean-up-webpages-for-note-taking-or-printing-the-easy-way/
  <rindolf>  jozefk: you can define a print stylesheet.
   <jozefk>  I want to clean the page from everything. not only to see it
             like that on screen but to really modify the code
  <rindolf>  jozefk: well, you can read what the bookmarklet is doing and
             emulate it.
   <jozefk>  I see the javascript code from bookmarklet but I think I
             can't modify real files on hard disk with javacript codes
   <jozefk>  and the code is more than 300 lines :)
    <tm604>  sure you can, js runs serverside happily enough, but it'd be
             just as easy to convert the JS logic to perl.
   <jozefk>  that sounds like programing. I thought there is some tool
             like that bookmarklet which I can use to modify files on HDD
  <Altreus>  tm604: except the JS runs on a DOM in a browser, with a
             browser context
    <tm604>  yes, it does sound a bit like programming, doesn't it? good
             thing this is a programming channel, so it's hopefully still
             on-topic.
  <Altreus>  I don't think there's a node module that will load an HTML
             file and create a browser context in which to then run JS on
             that HTML's DOM and output the result
   <jozefk>  :)
   <jozefk>  DOM is not so important here I think. because JS is removing
             everything from code and just applying another CSS
   <jozefk>  so the page looks different
    <tm604>  huh, thought there was. the script itself should be trivial
             to convert to perl either way.
  <Altreus>  probably a better idea :)
   <jozefk>  yeah, better. one day when I become a programmer :) I will do
             it.
 <pkrumins>  I want to become a brogrammer
   <jozefk>  why?

     <ncow>  rindolf: is not { my $c=0; sub getNext { $c++ } } a perfectly
             good way to do a closure on a variable (that should not be
             seen by anything other than that sub, sort of like that PHP
             example with the "static" var
             <http://www.phpsadness.com/sad/18> and I think similar to
             static vars in C++ and Java) ?
  <rindolf>  ncow: yes, it is.
      <uri>  ncow: you can use state vars in recent perls too
     <ncow>  but I keep thinking there was a way of doing it with outer
             and inner subs too, or no
  <rindolf>  ncow: thing is in sub outer { my $c = 0 ; .... } the $c is
             temporary.
     <ncow>  uri: yeah I just saw that in perlfaq7 just before you said
             that, thanks though :)
  <rindolf>  ncow: which causes weird side-effects with a package-scope
             inner sub.
     <ncow>  rindolf: but shouldn't the inner sub have a closure over $c
             though?
  <rindolf>  ncow: it will.
  <rindolf>  ncow: but every time you call outer() you get a different $c.
  <apeiron>  Windows also accepts a sledgehammer to the harddrive.
     <ncow>  rindolf: I'm talking about calling the inner one
     <ncow>  rindolf: could be interesting to call the outter one to
             re-prime or something (just kind of thinking aloud, I could
             be completely wrong)

             service (that is very picky about its scope) to call an OLE
             component for writing an Excel macro to do that.
  <apeiron>  And for those we have File::Spec.
  <rindolf>  apeiron: it's not as straightforward as in UNIX.
     <ncow>  I think I found a mis-type in perlfaq7
             <http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq7.html#How-do-I-create-a-static-variable%3f>,
             under "How do I create a static variable?"
     <ncow>  It says: sub counter { state $count = 1; $counter++ }
     <ncow>  I think that should be $count++ not $counter++
  <rindolf>  apeiron:
             http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-forum-unix-shooting-in-the-foot
  <rindolf>  ncow: yes, it should.
  <rindolf>  ncow: or "$state $counter = 1;".
     <ncow>  rindolf: oh shit, that is so true. I hate ActiveX like the
             mf-ing plauge
     <ncow>  rindolf: yes, though counter is the sub's name, I think the
             var was meant to be called $count
     <ncow>  as in the count that the counter counts :)
  <rindolf>  ncow++
  <rindolf>  ncow: it still exists in my github fork of the perl-doc-cats
             repo.
     <ncow>  a counter doesn't counter counters unless it is in fact a
             counter counter :)
      <uri>  ncow: go back to sesame street!
     <ncow>  lol
      <uri>  it seems to be where you learned your perl!
      <uri>  use Big::Bird;
     <ncow>  but does a counter counter count it self as a counter
             counter?
      <uri>  that is counterproductive thinking
     <ncow>  (or does it just consider itself a cunt and thus only count
             it self as a cunt counter since it only counts cunts?)
     <ncow>  ok I think I'm done with that one...
     <ncow>  sorry, when ever someone mentions ActiveX it makes me all
             twichy, and if there is no one around to choke into
             submition, I tend to write odd things, like a ram memory

 <Altreus>  no it's me

            intelligence one.
 <rindolf>  Altreus: or maybe natural intelligence.
 <Altreus>  well you're a poo poo head

            http://avatars.plurk.com/3405142-big.jpg) | six years old
 <Altreus>  That's generous
 <rindolf>  Altreus: calling someone a "poo poo head" proves that this
            person has natural stupidity.
 <Altreus>  rindolf: But the natural stupidity was postulated before the
            use of the phrase; hence you can't discount the fact that
            using the phrase was in response to, rather than proof of, the
            assertion.
 <rindolf>  Altreus: yes, but it still proved it after the fact.
 <rindolf>  Altreus: Q.E.D.
 <Altreus>  rindolf: Except it is possible for an intelligent system to
            act stupid
 <Altreus>  hence it is not, in fact, proof.
 <rindolf>  Altreus: that's right - it has the right to in fact.
 <Altreus>  Indeed. So given that it has the ability, the right, and the
            motivation to do so, it is reasonable to assume that in fact
            that is what happened
 <rindolf>  Altreus: OK.
 <Altreus>  You would have to gather further data on the system to
            determine it.
 <rindolf>  Altreus: in that case, calling someone a "poo poo head" has
            the property of having natural stupidity.
 <rindolf>  Or acting under the influence of natural stupidity.
 <rindolf>  Possibly artificial natural stupidity.
 <Altreus>  rindolf: artificial natural stupidity ._.
 <Altreus>  I think your sentence is at odds with itself
 <Altreus>  Well, your fragment
 <rindolf>  Altreus: it's an oxymoron.
 <Altreus>  correct
 <rindolf>  Oxymorons are indicative of natural stupidity.
 <Altreus>  I gave the artificial impression of natural stupidity!
 <Altreus>  Stupid phrases are an indication of a) stupidity or b)
            intelligence
 <rindolf>  Hence stupid phrases are not indicative.
 <Altreus>  Quite so
 <rindolf>  Only intelligent phrases can be indicative of something.
 <Altreus>  Stupidity is an absence, and you cannot prove an absence
            without first proving an exhaustive set.
 <rindolf>  Wise men know they are stupid.
 <Altreus>  :)
 <rindolf>  Whereas foolish people think they are not.
 <rindolf>  The earliest Greek philosophers tried to philosophise in
            verse.

 <Su-Shee>  SO I TURNED TO YOU FOR HELP IN TIMES OF DESPERATION…
   <Botje>  desperation is for wimps

 <Altreus>  deprecation is an outdated concept and we prefer not to do it
 <Su-Shee>  let’s deprecate deprecation.
 <alpha-->  agreed.
 <alpha-->  oh wait.
 <Su-Shee>  that would be a deprecation
 <rindolf>  Who will watch the watcher?
 <rindolf>  Who will deprecate deprecation?
 <Su-Shee>  shouldn’t someone deprecate the deprecator in that case?

            <Botje>  crane_work: 5.6 is ancient.
        <pink_mist>  crane_work: use perlbrew
            <mauke>  do you mean 5.6?
            <Botje>  crane_work: even 5.10 is end of line.
            <mauke>  then you need to install 5.6
            <mauke>  also, uninstall 5.6 and 5.10 and install 5.16
           <DrForr>  crane_work: Then install v5.6 with perlbrew. And pad
                     your keyboard for the inevitable <headdesk/>s.
           <DrForr>  And holy god why do you *need* something last
                     bugfixed in the last *century*.
            <Botje>  or, you know, use a version of perl developed *after*
                     9/11.
        <lesshaste>  mauke: would you be able to share the code with me?
       <crane_work>  lol ^^
            <mauke>  lesshaste: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/204936
        <lesshaste>  thanks!
            <Botje>  if necessary, tell your boss perl 5.16 has been
                     terrorism-proofed.
           <DrForr>  crane_work: Ha ha only *serious*. 5.6 is almost
                     unrecognizable under the cobwebs.
       <crane_work>  i guess this would be a pro argument...
        <pink_mist>  crane_work: as we've said a few times: perlbrew
        <lesshaste>  mauke: I get that's fast!
        <lesshaste>  I bet
            <mauke>  lesshaste: I doubt it
        <lesshaste>  we need someone to work on pyperl :)
            <mauke>  it seeks all over the place
        <lesshaste>  mauke: why?
        <lesshaste>  ah ok
              <huf>  c code with perl reindenting is ... strange
            <mauke>  but that's why I wanted to test it on a nontrivial
                     data set :-)
           <DrForr>  Why would compiling to a different VM do any good?...
           <DrForr>  Oh, because it's python, therefore better. Silly me.
              <huf>  it'd force people to understand (and fix) the darkest
                     corners of the perl grammar? *shrug* dunno
            <mauke>  grammar and semantics
              <huf>  that too. the vote on how to interpolate
                     $length[1234] into regexes doesnt make me feel
                     good...
        <lesshaste>  DrForr: it's not really python
        <lesshaste>  DrForr: In fact, it's not python :)
        <lesshaste>  DrForr: they just did the same thing for PHP
        <lesshaste>  DrForr: and was some project for prolog etc in the
                     past
       <crane_work>  maybe this question would be stupid but... why if use
                     v5.06 is stupid is it possible to tell perl to use a
                     version?
            <mauke>  crane_work: what?
              <huf>  use v5.6 isnt stupid, it just does something other
                     than what you wanted.
        <lesshaste>  DrForr: the idea is simply that it would be *faster*
       <crane_work>  huf: in which cases will i need it=?
          <rindolf>  lesshaste: isn't pyperl this -
                     http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPerl ?
            <mauke>  when your code doesn't run on 5.005 and earlier
              <huf>  crane_work: use VERSION means your script requires at
                     least that version of perl. if an older one tries to
                     load it, it'll tell you to fuck off and get a newer
                     perl. it will not turn your new perl into an old one
                     however.
        <lesshaste>  rindolf: that has the same name :) I mean using pypy
                     to make a jit for perl as in http://pypy.org/
          <rindolf>  lesshaste: OK, there's perlito.

       <arkydo>  rindolf: How different is modern Hewbrew from classical

      <rindolf>  arkydo: Classical Hebrew? What's that?
        <thrig>  presumably with tuxes and violins instead of guitars
      <rindolf>  arkydo: there was Biblical Hebrew, Mishna'ic Hebrew,

       <arkydo>  rindolf: biblical Hebrew I mean.
 <grothendieck>  Post-Modern Hebrew :P
      <rindolf>  arkydo: I think Modern Hebrew is using the grammar of the
                 Mishna'ic Hebrew with the vocabulary of the Biblical
                 Hebrew.
        <thrig>  Atonal Hebrew, Serial Hebrew, Minimal Hebrew

 <sawyer_>  LeoNerd, i've decided to send the module author a request for
            comment on this, saying i cannot write my tests because i
            cannot override the port his client software uses
 <sawyer_>  perhaps he'll allow the user to override the port used
         *  LeoNerd nod
 <LeoNerd>  Sounds good
 <sawyer_>  considering the author though... i'm wary of the reply :P

 <sawyer_>  i once closed a ticket at $work accompanied with a yell over
            my office that said "and if you open that fucker again, i'm
            breaking a chair over your fucking face"
 <sawyer_>  but... that's just me :)
 <rindolf>  sawyer_: well, I once declined a patch on rt.cpan.org for
            HTML-Widgets-NavMenu, because it: 1. Broke some existing
            tests. 2. Was doable with some extra work.
 <rindolf>  sawyer_: hah.
 <sawyer_>  rindolf, what pissed me off was that he kept reopening a
            ticket for something that wasn't configured correctly. the
            problem was, i still haven't received the request to configure
            it in the first place.
 <rindolf>  I hate those tickets that get closed before it was released as
            a stable release.

 <federated_life>  once you get into poe and moose heavily…why stay with
                   perl instead of going to java ?
        <LeoNerd>  I've spent much of this last month writing Perl at home
                   and Java at work.. I really really dislike Java
        <Su-Shee>  federated_life: what for?
 <federated_life>  since being a real programmer is editing the binary
                   files directly instead of recompiling…but java has a
                   lot of nice stuff
        <LeoNerd>  It is far too new FutureFunction<Param,Result>() {
                   public Future<Result> apply(Param p) { noisy } } for my
                   liking
        <Su-Shee>  federated_life: WTF?
        <LeoNerd>  I always get annoyed that the smallest of things takes
                   just far too much code in Java, to the point that after
                   a glance, I can't see where the real detail is
        <Su-Shee>  federated_life: and what nice stuff does Java has?
        <apeiron>  federated_life, you know where Java is if you want it.
                   we're not stopping you.

                   what other languages you guys hack stuff up in
        <Su-Shee>  federated_life: then just use Java and leave us using
                   something else if you like it better.. also: plenty of
                   perl code doesn't even need Moose or POE

 <sliddjur>  i have a school assignment which tells me to: generate a
             password hash with perl's crypt.... i dont even know where to
             start. never used perl. :)
    <Botje>  perldoc -f crypt
    <Botje>  perlbot: tutorial
  <perlbot>  Botje: http://perl-tutorial.org |
             http://perl-begin.org/tutorials/ |
             http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Tutorials |
             http://learn.perl.org/
  <rindolf>  sliddjur: is this a highschool assignment?
  <rindolf>  sliddjur: or is it a university one?
  <rindolf>  sliddjur: surely you can learn Perl.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: who cares? homework is homework.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: so ? We help with homework.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: just trying to learn the enemy.
  <rindolf>  Be Prepared.
 <sliddjur>  :D
 <sliddjur>  its university, but its not a perl/programming class. its
             just a linuxadmnistration class
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: then think first. two minutes of google tell
             everybody how to use crypt.
  <Su-Shee>  sliddjur: sorry are you really not able to google how to
             generate a password IN UNIVERSITY?
          *  rindolf is listening to Alphaville - Forever Young (“Hoping
             for the best, but expecting the worst” - great song).
    <tm604>  i searched for crypt but all I found were halloween
             instructions :(
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: google for Perl stuff.
  <rindolf>  ?
  <rindolf>  Also http://duckduckgo.com/ is better and more consistent
             than Google.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yeah because Perl's crypt is TOTALLY different from
             all the other crypts.. ;)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: crypts are like snowflakes - no one alike.
  <rindolf>  ;-)
          *  rindolf has a huge and comprehensive collectionf of crypts on
             his hard disk.
  <rindolf>  I'll soon need to upgrade my hard disk for it.
  <rindolf>  OK, back to topic.
  <Su-Shee>  also seriously someone at _university_ can't research and
             learn on his own?
  <rindolf>  sliddjur: I suggest you learn some basic Perl properly from a
             good tutorial
  <rindolf>  sliddjur: http://perl-begin.org/tutorials/#perl_in_2hours -
             see this - it's good but see the caveats and unfortunately it
             is All Rights Reserved (ARR).
  <rindolf>  The author wants to “maintain control” of their work.
  <Su-Shee>  yes. many do. get over it.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: I cannot.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: well, I can for some time.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: then don't get over it in the privacy of your room.
             ;)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: OK.
          *  rindolf is heating up some water for some instant soup.
  <rindolf>  Maybe I'll heat up some Bourekas and/or red rice after that.
          *  rindolf is not much of a cook.
  <rindolf>  But when I'm hungry, I hack something.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: BTW, I think trying to understand Hegel is
             pointless.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: that or Aristotle's Meta-Physics.
  <rindolf>  A lot of high language that yields no gain.
  <rindolf>  And is of close to zero utility.
  <rindolf>  Like The Emperor's New Clothes that only smart people can
             see.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yeah that's what everybody thinks who has no clue of
             philosophy..
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: <Su-Shee> rindolf: yeah that's what everybody thinks
             who has no clue of philosophy.. ==> I rest my case.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: BTW, I was able to disprove some of the things I was
             told that Kant or
             http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard or
             Descartes said using logic and my own intuition.

   <b0at_>  rindolf: Depending on how many dimensions you think the

  <laouji>  what's a good smtp/mime mail module with few dependencies?
  <laouji>  Email::Sender seems to have Moo in it and all kinds of stuff I
            don't really need
 <rindolf>  laouji: why do you worry about dependencies?
  <laouji>  I guess I don't have to worry about them. I was just wondering
            if there was something lighter.
     <huf>  Moo is already light as hell
  <laouji>  ok lol
     <huf>  if you want something even lighter, see M :)
            https://metacpan.org/module/M
  <laouji>  beautiful
     <huf>  or Mo
  <laouji>  ok I will just use Email::Sender
     <huf>  although Mo is quite fat compared to M :)
  <DrForr>  There's now just 'M'... *that*'s gonna be simple to search
            for.
     <huf>  DrForr: there's still no .pm
     <huf>  use ;
 <rindolf>  huf: what's the "use;"?
     <huf>  rindolf: fewer deps! more lightweight!
 <rindolf>  Maybe require ''; will work.
 <rindolf>  huf: heh.
     <huf>  this one doesnt even need perl!
     <huf>  it "works" equally well with a tea towel
         *  rindolf writes a /bin/cat script.
     <huf>  sed 1d is better
  <DrForr>  Didn't we already do that for PPT?
  <DrForr>  Or is that just me showing my cynicism...
  <DrForr>  You could f*ck with people's heads and require a non-breaking
            space before the semicolon to make '.pm' work :)

               rectangular.
       <popl>  and there are no cats in Switzerland
 <hoverboard>  they just don't survive there?
    <Su-Shee>  also, the swiss get very cranky when they don't get
               chocolate on time. that's why the swiss metro/trains etc
               are so famously punctual.
       <popl>  cats don't eat cheese

   <rindolf>  Well, I mean «no users» -> «good users» not For each user ->
              user is not good.
 <pink_mist>  yes, the norwegian users are all good users :P
  <siamsara>  not like us users

   <rindolf>  Heh.

   <rindolf>  LeoNerd: OK.
   <rindolf>  LeoNerd: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95574
   <LeoNerd>  You do know these things are emailed to me, and so you don't
              need to highlight my attention on IRC right? :)
     <Botje>  hey LeoNerd, you should've received a mail about that ticket

       <huf>  ha!
       <huf>  at least one could "pop 'round"
       <huf>  i dont think that's legal outside britain
       <huf>  perhaps in the more colonier former colonies.
  <corgifex>  post it on stackoverflow, link it on /r/LeoNerd
       <huf>  why is there no /r/leonerd?

    <Su-Shee>  hm, was there a time datatype for duration in postgres? or
               am I just wishful thinking?

    <rindolf>  Radditz: nice. :-)

    <Su-Shee>  _DrForr: lemme look. merci.

    <_DrForr>  At least in 9.1.
            *  rindolf eats the underscore.
    <Su-Shee>  _DrForr: I have the latest and shiniest postgres.
    <_DrForr>  Haven't found and /killed my clone, I guess.
       <popl>  You'll spoil your dinner.
    <rindolf>  It was a good underscore. Minty with a hint of cranberries.
    <rindolf>  _DrForr: ah. /msg NickServ HELP GHOST?
    <Su-Shee>  oh genius. interval hour to minute is exactly what I need.
       <popl>  interval is awesome
    <rindolf>  PostgreSQL++
    <Su-Shee>  my favorite: allballs ;)
    <rindolf>  Underscores are the most nutritious punctuation. But you
               also need to eat letters, digits and whitespace for a
               balanced diet.

       <anno>  yeah, sure
    <rindolf>  Altreus: just a nap - lately I've been hypomanic so I sleep

               literally "Big Head" or "Small Head", Hebrew slang for
               taking initiative, and being awesome at your job or
               responsibilities regardless of how small they are.

    <rindolf>  perlbot: alias
    <perlbot>  rindolf: use the new mkalias command: mkalias foo <- bar
    <rindolf>  We need aliases for both rosh qatan and rosh katan
    <Su-Shee>  no, we don't.

    <rindolf>  In The Gilmore Girls ( ♥! ), Lorelai started off as a
               cleaner of that inn, and ended up running that place.
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: it is related to Perl.
    <Su-Shee>  no, it's not.
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: and it has nothing to do with sex/celebrities/etc.
    <Su-Shee>  yes and you can still stop dropping all your private shit
               into the bot.
    <_DrForr>  No, it's a term from a blog about software. It's as related
               to perl as 'scrum' is.
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: why do you think that perlbot should be about 100%
               perl stuff?
    <rindolf>  On irc.perl.org purl has stuff from Monty Python.
    <Su-Shee>  rindolf: the name "perl" bot might be an indicator. and
               we're not on irc.perl.org and purl is purl.
    <rindolf>  _DrForr++
    <_DrForr>  Historical accident.
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: well, we discussed Rosh Gadol/Qatan in the past
               here.
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: it's part of #perl's culture.
    <Su-Shee>  nice try. you're the only one who's dropping his culture
               into the bot. how about making your own bot for it.
    <_DrForr>  I'm guessing you mean 'you' there.
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: perlbot is the bot of #perl, #perlcafe, and
               related channels - not of the perl 5 programming language.
    <_DrForr>  So you're now the arbiter, I see.
    <rindolf>  _DrForr: what?
    <rindolf>  perlbot: define arbiter
    <perlbot>  rindolf: arbiter n 1: someone with the power to settle
               matters at will; "she was the final arbiter on all matters
               of fashion" [syn: {arbiter}, {supreme authority}] 2:

               critic was considered to be an arbiter of modern
               literature"; "the arbitrator's authority derived from the

               interesting times and judgements ahead.. ;)

    <Su-Shee>  I never cheat. I don't need to. Because you will nicely
               fall into your own sword without me even moving a finger.
               and we're almost there.
    <Su-Shee>  and I will have warned you and I will have made transparent

        <phx>  sounds like fun
    <Su-Shee>  mostly like "stupid"
    <rindolf>  Su-Shee: good luck.
    <rindolf>  Hubris!
    <LeoNerd>  Tests are overrated
    <rindolf>  Well, a good amount of hubris is useful in moderation.
    <LeoNerd>  If it breaks, your users will let you know
    <rindolf>  LeoNerd: heh.
    <LeoNerd>  .oO( mine do ;) )
    <rindolf>  We wouldn't have had modern tech without Hubris.
    <rindolf>  Or without neophilia.

    <rindolf>  jkg: necrophilia?
        <jkg>  haha
        <jkg>  I just realised, I completely misread you.
        <jkg>  I did think it was a bit weird...
    <rindolf>  jkg: yes, neophilia - love of novelty.
    <rindolf>  jkg: possibly being a hipster.
        <jkg>  sure, I know the word - I just misread and thought you'd
               dialled the weirdness up another notch ;)
    <rindolf>  Both neophilia and hubris should be done in moderation.
    <rindolf>  well, arguably a necrophil is someone who uses antiquated
               stuff.

               ddosin' for him?
 <dont-panic>  go play with ping and send exceedingly large and canadian
               packets
    <locsmif>  Anti-ddos? How does that work if it's a packet storm unless

 <johndoemer>  what is the best way to find a nice job doing perl in los
               angeles?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: jobs.perl.org?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: there's also the LA Perl mongers.
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: and a jobs mailing list.
 <johndoemer>  I never did a mailing list since in like 95 when I got 500
               emails in 1 day from one
 <johndoemer>  are they safe?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: note that I'm trying not to be picky about
               which jobs I get -
               http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/
               ?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: what do you mean by "safe"?
  <preaction>  johndoemer: you can set up filters. also, the pm lists are
               usually pretty low-volume
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: what is the worst thing you suspect will
               happen?
 <johndoemer>  I guess I never learned how to use a mailing list
 <johndoemer>  so I sign up and how do I read it without getting 500
               emails a day?
  <preaction>  look at the archives to see how many e-mails get sent per
               day
 <johndoemer>  I dunno I just gota escape this unix admin job stuff im
               doing
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: put it in a separate folder.
 <johndoemer>  just the interviews driving me batty

 <johndoemer>  holy crap did they make 8 harry potter films?

    <rindolf>  johndoemer: yes.
  <preaction>  7 books, +1 last split in two
 <johndoemer>  the first was one of worst movies ever and glorification of
               government school elitism over capitalism is gross garbage

               sysadmins so they wont tell us we are morons
 <johndoemer>  I know sql
 <johndoemer>  but what version of "expert" I am I dont know

    <rindolf>  flight18: what?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: Saladin style.
   <flight18>  Pretty amazing, huh?
 <johndoemer>  whos that?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: Saladin was « Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb
               (Arabic: صلاح الدين يوسف بن أيوب‎; Kurdish: سه‌لاحه‌دین
               ئه‌یوبی , Selahedînê Eyûbî) (1137/1138 – March 4, 1193),
               better known in the Western world as Saladin was a Muslim
               Sultan who liberated most of Palestine from the rule of the
               Knights Templar and the Christian crusaders,»
 <johndoemer>  paladin? like a holy warrior?
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: the first true Hacker Monarch/Warrior Monarch.
     <Grinnz>  sounds like a guy that should have been in assassin's creed
               1 :)
     <Grinnz>  ah, he was
 <johndoemer>  I want a movie whwereknights templar kill a lot of bad guys
 <johndoemer>  thats be awesome
    <rindolf>  Grinnz: heh.
 <johndoemer>  knights of the round table!
 <johndoemer>  yeah!
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: King Arthur predates the knights templar.
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: there were quite a few films about Saladin.
     <Grinnz>  johndoemer, except in assassin's creed, the knights templar
               are the bad guys ;)
 <johndoemer>  why bad?
 <johndoemer>  didnt they guard the galazxy against evil for athousdan
               generations?
 <johndoemer>  using the force?
    <rindolf>  The Legend of Robin Hood is generally set in the time of
               Richard I/Saladin, but the earliest british records predate
               that.
    <rindolf>  johndoemer: heh.
     <Grinnz>  johndoemer, because they want to control the world, etc
 <johndoemer>  awesome
 <johndoemer>  same as the brits did briefly eh
    <rindolf>  Grinnz: well, the Knights Templar started as paranoid,
               murderous and violent and mostly mentally ill.
 <johndoemer>  menatlly ill?
 <johndoemer>  hah
 <johndoemer>  smart sounds like to me
 <johndoemer>  had multinatinoal mob
 <johndoemer>  i bet they hid lots of hot women in thier holds
 <johndoemer>  n a[prtied
 <johndoemer>  sign me up
     <Grinnz>  do you by chance have any foreign substances in your
               bloodstream?
 <johndoemer>  unix adminning is pissing me off
    <rindolf>  Grinnz: and after Saladin was throught with them, they were
               happy, noble, peaceful mostly sane, and unwilling to fight
               him.
 <johndoemer>  nop
 <johndoemer>  just pissed at bad unix admin job interviews gone bad
 <johndoemer>  and outa work
 <johndoemer>  not sure what to do
  <preaction>  get your skills up-to-date with the new orchestration
               technologies?
   <flight18>  johndoemer, why are you here?

 <johndoemer>  u?
 <johndoemer>  I kinda dont believe in cronfig maangemtn orchestraaation
  <preaction>  this is a Perl support channel. the Perl chat channel is on
               irc.perl.org
 <johndoemer>  I believe in client server computing
 <johndoemer>  and concurrency at language level, name based virtual hosts
 <johndoemer>  etc
     <Grinnz>  there are people who don't believe in name based virtual
               hosts?
  <preaction>  how is any of that against configuration management?
 <johndoemer>  well why have 10 urls on 10 vms mate, if u can have 10 on 2
               servers, with name based virtual hosts eh?

    <qizwiz>  so I can't do a recursive include with PERL5LIB?
    <qizwiz>  I have to defend every code change and this is really for my
              own use (emacs)
   <rindolf>  qizwiz: you can try using File::Find or whatever.
       <huf>  qizwiz: depends on how you set it
       <huf>  shell has glob too :)
       <huf>  or you can write a script and symlink everything together

      <anno>  recursive?
     <mauke>  use an overlay mount!
       <huf>  fish bananas old pajamas butter'd scones for lunch?
   <Grinnz_>  qizwiz: theres no such thing as a recursive lib dir; you
              need a base lib dir, so that things like
              Some::Deep::Namespace::Module can be found at
              Some/Deep/Namespace/Module.pm
   <Grinnz_>  it doesn't search very hard for these things, it just goes
              by @INC
           *  ImaginaryFriend has quit (Quit: leaving)
    <qizwiz>  or I could just use emacs itself to build the env variable.
              That's probably easiest.
   <Alchemy>  qizwiz, http://perldoc.perl.org/lib.html
   <Grinnz_>  well, "easiest" would be to remake the "cpan modules" dir by
              using cpanm or something to download whatever specific
              versions you need ;)
   <kaitlyn>  <required joke about emacs here>
   <Alchemy>  <required joke about plumbers fixing emacs problem>
    <qizwiz>  Grinnz: that's not an obvious solution to me. What do you
              mean exactly?
   <Grinnz_>  qizwiz: instead of having cpan modules installed in
              different lib dirs, install them all to the same lib dir
 <sproingie>  @INC can contain functions, but that's getting even more
              insane
   <Grinnz_>  they are designed to coincide
   <rindolf>  kaitlyn:
              http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-your-emacs-so-fat
 <sproingie>  debugging a dynamic @INC will be hell on wheels
   <Grinnz_>  qizwiz: and cpanm can be directed to install a specific
              version of a module with "cpanm Module::Name@1.2345"
   <Grinnz_>  but you'd have to set it up so it's installing to the right
              dir first
 <sproingie>  carton is perfect for that
   <Grinnz_>  right, or that
   <kaitlyn>  rindolf: All joking aside, emacs is a great editor. I just
              don't know enough LISP to properly start it.
 <sproingie>  wait, emacs is also an editor?
   <kaitlyn>  sproingie: I'm pretty sure it's an IRC client.
   <Grinnz_>  i thought it was another improved replacement for sysvinit
    <qizwiz>  sproingie: Actually, not really. I can take whatever
              function I'm runing on emacs that's going to hit @INC in
              some way and 'advise' it to set the PERL5LIB variable before
              it's run. I can even cache it to make it more performant
 <sproingie>  i'm sure the next systemd will have emacs built in
   <rindolf>  Grinnz_: heh.
   <Grinnz_>  sproingie: not sure, i think it will be the other way around

    <hekmek>  with prior coding experience it is

 <pink_mist>  Soltis: don't you mean Summer Glau?

              weakening the pool of potential improvements on either side
   <LeoNerd>  It's a sortof last-ditch attempt
   <Su-Shee>  who would ever ditch LeoNerd.. ;)
           *  LeoNerd hopes nobody suggests LeoNerd::Tiny
 <sproingie>  the stuff i fork tends to be fairly obscure anyway
           *  rindolf suggests LeoNerd::Minuscule
    <alpha->  Leo::Nerd
 <sproingie>  cPanel::LeoNerd
     <thrig>  LeoNerd::MaybeXS
    <cfedde>  some times it would be nice to have a simple CLI for
              LeoNerd.

   <Altreus>  LeoNerd: why, are you getting bloated?
   <Altreus>  feature reep
   <Altreus>  c
   <Altreus>  Feature: creep
   <Su-Shee>  I would fall off my chair of laughter just now if I wouldn't
              sit on a futon...
   <LeoNerd>  Altreus: No, I just don't see why I need to be able to be
              installed on a no-deps core-only setup :)
   <Altreus>  Aren't you core?
 <sproingie>  use feature 'creep';
   <Altreus>  #perl without LeoNerd in it is not a complete installation
   <Su-Shee>  so true. :)
   <LeoNerd>  I still wonder if I should have taken the CPAN name
              'LEONERD' instead
   <Altreus>  oh I just asked the previous maintainer for someone's
              address and then found it earlier in the pod -_-
   <Su-Shee>  LeoNerd: OF COURSE YOU SHOULD HAVE
   <Altreus>  LeoNerd: we all have regrets
   <Altreus>  LeoNerd: why not both dot jpg
 <sproingie>  egrets, i've had a few
   <Su-Shee>  LeoNerd: who on earth - other than your parents - knows
              you're pevans?!
   <Altreus>  I feel reasonably unique in having my nick on cpan
   <LeoNerd>  Su-Shee: wellll... the prevailing theme on PAUSE does seem
              to be initial lastname
   <LeoNerd>  So I just went with that

   <ZadYree>  oh, thanks
   <rindolf>  tm604++ # Helping ZadYree
   <ZadYree>  rindolf, eww ;)
   <rindolf>  ZadYree: mewww!
 <pink_mist>  0_o eww?
   <ZadYree>  Eww!
   <rindolf>  pink_mist: ZadYree and I say "ewwww" to each other for
              greeting or approval.
  <blue_sky>  not oooh?
   <rindolf>  pink_mist: it started from a conversation we had when I said
              I'm going to say "Ewwwww" for everything people told me
              about what they were doing.
   <rindolf>  pink_mist: after someone told me "XML? Ewwwww!" when I told
              him I'm working with XML.
   <rindolf>  So I said something like "You ate an apple? Ewwww!"
 <pink_mist>  rindolf: heh, right :P
   <rindolf>  pink_mist: ewwww!
   <rindolf>  ;-)
 <pink_mist>  now I'm going to go into town and get pizza ... it's
              horrible being out in the countryside and not being able to
              get pizza without making it yourself! =(
    <Soltis>  pizza: ewww!
   <rindolf>  pink_mist: Pizza! Yum yum.
   <rindolf>  Soltis: heh, you're doing it right.
   <rindolf>  Soltis++
   <ZadYree>  Finally works fine playing with scalar context. Damn, such
              solutions make me understand I am way far from mastering
              Perl.
   <rindolf>  ZadYree: awesome.
     <tm604>  perlbot, lists and things

     <tm604>  ^ might help
    <Soltis>  Homemade pizza while living in the sticks-- that brings back
              traumatic memories.
    <Soltis>  (PROTIP: never use whole wheat under-aged sourdough for
              pizza crust)
   <snakpak>  ewww indeed
    <Soltis>  My parents were not good cooks.
    <Soltis>  Still aren't, actually.
    <Soltis>  If someone tells me their food is just like my mother used
              to make, I'll run for the hills.
   <Altreus>  pink_mist: it's horrible being in town and getting pizza you
              don't make yourself, though
   <Altreus>  unless you have a Pizza Stop like we do cos they do really
              good pizza
   <Altreus>  DO YOU
     <vague>  Altreus, how about a pizza place where you make your own
              pizza?
     <vague>  With all the toppings
   <rindolf>  perlbot: vague
   <perlbot>  rindolf: vague question is really, really vague, in fact
              it's so fucking vague that you can't even caption a cat with
              it because the cat would DIE OF VAGUE |
              http://www.trout.me.uk/vague.jpg
   <rindolf>  vague: you must get highlighted a lot.
     <vague>  rindolf, I do. Stop using my name so frivolously
   <rindolf>  vague: OK.
     <vague>  Thank you :)
       <jkg>  do not take vague's name in vague.
       <jkg>  I mean, in vain.
   <Altreus>  /nick vain
   <Altreus>  oi
     <vague>  Don't take it at all. I have it registered and ghosted!
   <Altreus>  vague: sounds like an excuse to charge customers for the
              privilege of saving you money
     <vague>  Whatever floats my boat
   <Altreus>  bouyancy
      <popl>  imagination
      <popl>  vague doesn't have a boat
   <Altreus>  irrelevant
   <Altreus>  Boats all float by the same mechanic
   <Altreus>  if there's no boat there's no float and the physics doesn't
              matter
      <popl>  Altreus: imagined boats can float by whichever mechanics the
              imaginer decides.
   <Altreus>  surely they can't float at all
   <Altreus>  since the floating would also be imaginary
    <Soltis>  Imagined boats are sususpended by vague plausibility.
   <DrForr_>  That's far too compelex for this discussion.
   <Altreus>  Soltis is just gratuitously highlighting vague, which I am
              all for
   <Altreus>  for which I am all

   <rindolf>  Varsuchi: but "true" is not a Perl built-in.
  <Varsuchi>  ..........
  <Varsuchi>  so 1 or 0 then
  <Varsuchi>  instead of true?
   <Grinnz_>  usually, yes
   <rindolf>  perlbot: false
   <perlbot>  rindolf: undef, 0, "", "0"
   <rindolf>  Varsuchi: just use it in boolean context.

  <Varsuchi>  diddnt know perl didnt support bools
  <Varsuchi>  makes sense!
   <Grinnz_>  it does, just everything is a bool
   <Altreus>  it does support bools, it just doesn't select two values and
              name them
       <huf>  because bool is a way of looking at things
       <huf>  not a thing itself
           *  anno looks at huf boolishly
   <Altreus>  Varsuchi: true is a property of a value, not a value

      <anno>  i see
 <pink_mist>  my $huf = 0; #my huf isn't truthy :P
   <Altreus>  it's truthy, it's just not truey
   <Grinnz_>  our $huf = ''; # our huf is empty inside
 <pink_mist>  our @huf = (); # it's just an empty shell

              nudist handles
       <huf>  pink_mist: let's go with that
 <pink_mist>  it returns a true value after all :P
