Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts if I had some more
creative shells to script in…

ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL, SHR, JNE, etc.

shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands. Read, write, move left,
move right. Capable of producing any programming language imaginable, given
enough time and nerves of steel.

GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?

Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains all possible values
simultaneously. Method of scripting: isolate the universe in which the desired
result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.

Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But then, if these shells
existed, and I knew a sysadmin who used any of them, you can believe Sysadmin
Day would be a far more celebrated holiday.

The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market.

…

But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which unwanted
goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever, deceptive
advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism dominates
most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism are
synonymous.

Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is the
basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning for a
specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to act
morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human biological
needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty, Khan's total
actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive force in becoming a
mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs). The highly destructive,
irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall dictatorial military actions
far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context "moral" actions. …Genghis Khan was
enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write useful
code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP and Perl
(at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty of bad code
written in Ruby too.

This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham is
rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will get
rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They write
good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"

It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
and 12 years old.)

(I mean, if you really just can't read regular expressions, why not admit it?
You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double or
triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries. That
is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just look at
any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this

Recently, Richard Stallman gave a speech in which he illustrated an academic
point about programming history by quoting a guy who described vi as 'an
editor spread at sword-point and which is really hard to use'.

I think I speak for all moderate vi(m) users when I say -- DEATH and DAMNATION
(in that order) to this Cardinal of the CTRL key! Needless to say my own local
vim user group has dispatched assassins to kill Mr. Stallman, but this is
hardly the end of the story. The fact is that a man has referred to another
man who in turn expressed some often-voiced reservations about OUR EDITOR! On
behalf of all editors of text everywhere, I implore EMACS users to return to
the true path, lest you be burned at the stake and then go to hell, the Buffer
From Which There Is No Unloading. We'll see how productive you are then, with
your ctrl-meta-alt and your ELISP and your 'ring buffer', whatever THAT is.

Peace and love to all.

The thing is, I don't actually enjoy debugging my own machines. I _much_
prefer having other people debug _their_ machines, and fixing my machine in
the process. So I didn't want just something that worked on the Mac Mini, I
wanted something that works _universally_, so that hopefully people who are
even crazier than me will waste _their_ time trying to get these machines
working.

Re:Silly Iranians… ALWAYS!

First, they came for the newspapers, and I did nothing because the Farsi Side
comic was just re-prints now.

Next, they came for the books, and I looked the other way because the Death to
America Book of the Month Club was only recommending books to burn anyway.

Then, they came for the Satellite Dishes, and I said nothing because I still
had a year left on my Infidelphia Cable contract.

Finally, they came for my Internet Service, and no one was left to hear my

Review of the Oxford English Dictionary on Amazon.com:

[One Star]

"an epic work that has trouble holding the interest"

By: a customer

I'm at the ABs, and I still can't get a grip on the plot. Characters enter,
are introduced in exhausting detail -- and then disappear again! Very
frustrating. The only time an old character shows up again is in another's
history! A lot like _A Dance to the Music of Time_, I suppose.

Perhaps things will become clearer when we meet Oxford, English or Dictionary
-- clearly three key figures. Some kind of menage a trois?

Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
word "selfishness" in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word "selfishness"
does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. …As with
selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational
behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.

Extra Peculiar

Did you watch Uri Geller's show last night? He said that if anything
extraordinary happened at home during the show, people should phone in, or
report it at his website. During the entire show I was installing Hebrew
Windows XP for my mother-in-law, and something extraordinary did happen. The
operating system got installed, came up, ran without a glitch. Should I report
this to Uri?

khatul's comment:

Without a glitch, huh? Apparently you (and Uri) managed to install Linux from
a Windows XP installation CD. This is much more than telekinesis. It smells
like pure alien intervention. Report immediately!

It's one of those rare "perfect" kernels. So if it doesn't happen to compile
with your config (or it does compile, but then does unspeakable acts of
perversion with your pet dachshund), you can rest easy knowing that it's all
your own d*mn fault, and you should just fix your evil ways.

You could send me and the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of
course. (And perhaps pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that we'd be
interested, of course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next time).

In a widely anticipated move, Linux "headcase" Torvalds today announced the
immediate availability of the most advanced Linux kernel to date, version
2.6.20.

Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have been
involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some even
spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI to a
thousand decimal places.

The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial syntax
errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing the compile,
but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the compile warnings,
sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past.

As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd' constituency
finally has something to do while the rest of the country sits comatose in
front of their 65" plasma screens".

Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks by
Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed out that
not all of their members are either pasty nor white. "Some of them even
shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping hurts nerds'
standing in society.

Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were heard
wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more culturally aware
of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't even round.

Slashdot Comment on Reasons to or not to use MySQL:

A nice flame war. I'm just going to sit back, crack a beer and enjoy it. It is
almost memorial day weekend, you know. Hopefully it get hot enough in here to
roast a hot dog.

Oh goody! I'll help get things going:

* * MySQL users will have to wait until you are done with the fire before they
can roast their hot dogs, since MySQL is not a real database and does not
support concurrent roasting;

* * I've read the PostgreSQL manual eight times and still can't figure out
something as bloody simple as roasting a hot dog, though I did figure out I
have to call VACUUM before I can apply ketchup;

* * Serious enterprises who care about their hot dogs use Oracle, since you
can roast over 10,000 dogs at once and optionally impart the taste of filet
mignon;

* * If you try to roast a footlong hotdog using MySQL it will silently
truncate it to regular size, causing your child to cry;

* * Oracle will sue you if you complain about the difficulty of starting your
fire or the blackened taste of the dogs;

* * With SQLite your hot dogs are pre-roasted;

* * Last year on Memorial Day, mysqld leapt out of my MacBook Pro and pushed
my cousin into the fire, resulting in third degree burns. And also it causes
cancer. And terrorism. Blindness. Violent puppy death. BOO! MYSQL IS SCARY
DON'T USE MYSQL!!

Poetical sing-song or hypnotically rhythmic meter are often found in the
rhetoric of dictators, evangelists, sibyls, politicians, theologians,
mountebanks, social "intellectuals", media men, medicine men, hallucinating
psychotics, chanting shiites, and screaming terrorists. Consider how millions
of normally rational Germans thrilled and responded to the poetical cadence
and charisma of the consummate altruist neocheater, Adolph Hitler. The
results: a reign of destruction with tens of millions of human beings
slaughtered so one impotent man could indulge his mysticism to feel unearned
power. All that slaughter was for nothing more than to let one neocheater feel
a pseudo self-esteem. …Twenty million dead so one pip-squeak could feel big
and important.

"So what!" cry the mystics as the lifetime efforts of a thousand productive,
innocent individuals are blown to bits every day without a backward glance. So
what if the troops roll across the country with military cadence and guns
ablaze. So what if they level town after town, reducing to rubble and corpses
all the values, beauty, and life that took generations of productive effort to
build.

And that is all the chanting religious automatons or splendid Panzer divisions
know how to do -- to destroy in a moment, without a thought, all the values
that producers labored for lifetimes to build. Chanting mobs or marching
troops never glance back, never think for a moment of the death and
destruction they leave behind. So what! the mystics and neocheaters cry. So
what if genocide happens in Russia, Nazi Germany, Cuba, Cambodia, Red China,
or in our land. "I don't want to hear it! To hell with the lifetime efforts of
productive individuals! …Save the snail darter!"

"They felt Jesus would not have approved of copyright breaches."

Jesus, you da man! Stick it to those kids!

You might be interested to note that the students had studied "Exodus 20:15 -
you shall not steal" which comes a little way before Jesus anyway. Wasn't the
whole point of Jesus coming to make the "new commandment" that people "love
one another as I have loved you" and to annul the previous commandments that
were given to Moses? I was raised Christian and was Christian for a long time
but now am not, but I can't quite remember the specifics of this point.

Anyway, the point is that Jesus probably would have told them to stick Exodus
to the man and just get on with the lovin'. Or something.

What’s there not to like with C++/CLI? You can have macros expanding to
templates from which generics are generated, and then have classes generated
from the generics. And these classes can have a close function and two
destructors, and hold references to unmanaged pointers to managed pointers!
With C++, you only have duplicate features, but with C++/CLI, you can finally
have triplicate ones! You see, this is a language for an expert. Experts love
having 3 different ways to do things, each broken in its own way.

Apart from the fact that I congratulate you for writing bugless software
without peer review, I also congratulate you for being able to write a fully
RFC compliant MLM that won't blow up when you receive input you didn't account
for.

Quite frankly, even a crappy sysadmin can get a reasonable mailman setup
working (including nice archiving), quicker than the best coder can rewrite a
full MLM from scratch. And you still have time left over to modify/fix/improve
mailman to do the few things it didn't do quite right for you.

But if your attitude to coding is "I'd rather rewrite all this than soiling my
eyes and hands looking at someone else's code", that's not a very good way to
get hired anywhere as a coder, and even if you are super brilliant, you end up
being a DJB that people snicker at with "that guy thinks he's so bright that
he had to write his own libc" (instead of fixing/wrapping the few problematic
pieces of them, and in the case of reasonable maintainers, contributing the
code back).

Among the generalists, the conventional wisdom is that the worse-is-better
approach is more adaptive. Personally, I get a little tired of the argument:
My worse-is-better is better than your worse-is-better because I'm better at
being worser! Is it really true that the worse-is-better approach always wins?
With Perl 6 we're trying to sneak one better-is-better cycle in there and hope
to come out ahead before reverting to the tried and true worse-is-better
approach. Whether that works, only time will tell.

Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows
underneath it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and
without any services ?

That sounds preposterous to me.

If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers
without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error
in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office
? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is
a very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.

Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not
sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence
overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to
achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could
never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years,
but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft.

Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the
point where it runs the entire computer fron start to finish, without using
some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.

I think you need to re-examine your assumptions.

Linux Genuine Advantage™ is an exciting and mandatory new way for you to place
your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!

According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of
Linux are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts
them at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without
periodically phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to
continue functioning. These users are also missing out on the Advantage of
paying ongoing licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating
properly.

To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
download: Linux Genuine Advantage™!

Finally! Linux users can experience a feature that until now remained the
exclusive domain of proprietary software.

Once you've installed Linux Genuine Advantage™, you'll want to register and
send in your licensing fees to receive these important benefits:

* Your computer, which worked just fine before, will continue functioning
normally!

* Our software which you just installed will not disable logins on your
computer (as long as our license server keeps working properly)!

* It's totally awesome! We might not raise the yearly licensing fees in the
future!

Plus, if you act now, we promise not to launch unfounded lawsuits against you,
slander you or our competitors in the press and the courts (possibly by using
other smaller companies as pawns), or require you to pay us for software you
won't use on every new computer you buy!

you'd like to license Linux Genuine Advantage™, we'd love to enter into a
lucrative licensing agreement. With the money you save, you could put the WGA
programmers onto other tasks, like improving Vista!

02/03/2007 - The Linux Genuine Advantage™ crack is spreading! Someone uploaded
it to The Pirate Bay! Looks like it's time to get more involved in Swedish
politics from across the globe!

If you were a Unix programmer you either programmed in C or shell. And there
really wasn't much in between. There were these little languages that we used
on top of shell, but that was the big divide. The big revelation that hatched
Perl, as it were, was that this opened up into a two-dimensional space. And C
was good at something I like to call manipulexity, that is the manipulation of
complex things. While shell was good at something else which I call
whipuptitude, the aptitude for whipping things up.

So Perl was hatched. As a small egg. That was Perl 1. And it was designed from
the very beginning to evolve. The fact that we put sigils in front of the
variables meant that the namespaces were protected from new keywords. And that
was intentional, so we could evolve the language fairly rapidly without
impacting.

And it evolved… And it evolved… And finally we got to Perl 5. And… So… Perhaps
the Perl 6 slogan should be "All Your Paradigms Are Belong To Us". We'll get
to that.

So I'd like to start off with my own irrationalities.

I don't think syntax should dangle in the wind. I'm with Aristotle. I think
things should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Which means I like K&R
bracketing. I do not like the way that Python hangs stuff out there, with no
end.

I think that ordinary people dislike abstraction. That's because I dislike
abstraction and I think I'm ordinary. (laughter) I might be wrong about that,
but I don't know.

I simultaneously believe that languages are wonderful and awful. You have to
hold both of those. Ugly things can be beautiful. And beautiful can get ugly
very fast. You know, take Lisp. You know, it's the most beautiful language in
the world. At least up until Haskell came along. (laughter) But, you know,
every program in Lisp is just ugly. I don't figure how that works.

I think visual metaphors are very important. How it looks. Different things
should look different. Similar things should look similar. A language designer
simultaneously has to care what other people think, and has to not care what
other people think. Otherwise you go crazy. Well, crazier. (laughter)

And finally, I think God has free will. And therefore he created programmers
with free will and that they ought to be given choices.

    -- Larry Wall
    -- Present Continuous, Future Perfect ( http://www.perl.org.il/presentations/larry-wall-present-continuous-future-perfect/transcript.html )
%
Now, I'm not the only language designer with irrationalities. You can think of
some languages to go with some of these things.

* "We've got to start over from scratch" - Well, that's almost any academic
language you find.

* "English phrases" - Well that's Cobol. You know, cargo cult English.
(laughter)

* "Text processing doesn't matter much" - Fortran.

* "Simple languages produce simple solutions" - C.

* "If I wanted it fast, I'd write it in C" - That's almost a direct quote from
the original awk page.

* "I thought of a way to do it so it must be right" - That's obviously PHP.
(laughter and applause)

* "You can build anything with NAND gates" - Any language designed by an
electrical engineer. (laughter)

* "This is a very high level language, who cares about bits?" - The entire
scope of fourth generation languages fell into this… problem.

* "Users care about elegance" - A lot of languages from Europe tend to fall
into this. You know, Eiffel.

* "The specification is good enough" - Ada.

* "Abstraction equals usability" - Scheme. Things like that.

* "The common kernel should be as small as possible" - Forth.

* "Let's make this easy for the computer" - Lisp. (laughter)

* "Most programs are designed top-down" - Pascal. (laughter)

* "Everything is a vector" - APL.

* "Everything is an object" - Smalltalk and its children. (whispered:) Ruby.
(laughter)

* "Everything is a hypothesis" - Prolog. (laughter)

* "Everything is a function" - Haskell. (laughter)

* "Programmers should never have been given free will" - Obviously, Python.
(laughter)

So my psychological conjecture is that normal people, if they perceive that a
computer language is forcing them to learn theory, they won't like it. In
other words, hide the fancy stuff. It can be there, just hide it.

Back to dimensionality. When you are saying something linguistically, it's
like taking a trip. You know, when you take a trip from California to Netanya,
you don't go straight south and then straight west and then straight north.
It's not orthogonal. There are little bits at the beginning. Then you take
bigger hops on the planes and then you take littler hops at the end. Language
works the same way, it's fractal. There is little orthogonality. At least
apparently; you can have orthogonal views of it, there are orthogonal subsets.
But there are multiple orthogonal subsets. At first glance it just looks like
a network, and you have to navigate the geography.

Now in terms of the anthropology we try to welcome people into the tribe. We
allow people to have their own little fiefdoms, where they are the ruler and
can beat up on their followers.

We try to let people share with each other. We try to capture knowledge. Both
of those things are why we have the CPAN, Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
which is arguably one of the greatest repositories of reusable crappy software
in the world. (laughter).

And we have a culture of cooperating with other cultures too. We try to make
Parrot so that other languages can ran on top of that. We've always tried to
hook up Perl with everything. In kind of a humble sort of way. And finally
it's culture of fun. At least we try to make it that way. And that's why I
give weird talks.

When the first caveman programmer chiseled the first program on the walls of
the first cave computer, it was a program to paint the string `Hello, world'
in Antelope pictures. Roman programming textbooks began with the `Salut,
Mundi' program. I don't know what happens to people who break with this
tradition, but I think it's safer not to find out. We'll start with a series
of hello world programs that demonstrate the different aspects of the basics
of writing a kernel module.

The difference between a program and a script isn't as subtle as most people
think. A script is interpreted, and a program is compiled.

Of course, there's no reason you can't write a compiler that immediately
executes the compiled form of a program without writing compilation artifacts
to disk, but that's an implementation detail, and precision in technical
matters is important.

Though Perl 5, for example, doesn't write out the artifacts of compilation to
disk and Java and .Net do, Perl 5 is clearly an interpreter even though it
evaluates the compiled form of code in the same way that the JVM and the CLR
do. Why? Because it's a scripting language.

Okay, that's a facetious explanation.

The difference between a program and a script is if there's native compilation
available in at least one widely-used implementation. Thus Java before the
prevalence of even the HotSpot JVM and its JIT was a scripting language and
now it's a programming language, except that you can write a C interpreter
that doesn't have a JIT and C programs become scripts.

    -- chromatic
    -- "Program vs. Script" ( http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/35804 )
%
Of course, if someone were to write an extra optimizer step for Perl 5 to
evaluate certain parts of the optree and generate native code in memory on
certain platforms without writing it out to disk (uh oh…) and then execute
that code under certain conditions, all Perl 5 scripts would automatically
turn into programs. You know, like .pmc files, or Python's .pyc files. Uh.

As well, if more people use Punie (Perl 1 on Parrot) this year than native
Perl 1 -- a possibility -- then Perl 1 scripts automatically become Perl 1
programs because Punie can use Parrot's JIT. I don't know if this powerful
upgrade from script to program is retroactive, but I see no reason why not.

Perl 5 scripts were briefly programs while Ponie was viable, but the removal
of the code from the Parrot tree has now downgraded them back to scripts. We
apologize for the inconvenience.

    -- chromatic
    -- "Program vs. Script" ( http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/35804 )
%
To summarize, if you have a separate compilation step visible to developers,
you have programs. If not, you have scripts. An exception is that if you have
a separate, partial compilation step at runtime and not visible to users, then
you may have programs. The presence of one implementation that performs
additional compilationy thingies at runtime instantly upgrades all scripts to
programs, while the presence of an interpreter for a language in which people
normally write programs, not scripts, does not downgrade programs to scripts.
Program-ness is sticky.

I hope this is now clear.

Ironically some JavaScript implementations have JITs, so the colloquial name
of the language should change from JavaScript to JavaProgram.

Script bad, four-legs good.

I have to say I cringed a little when I read it, because it helps reinforce
the idea that there's a sort of Perl Hierarchy, or that there are Perl Gods,
or that "you must be this tall to ride".

Randal and I are just normal ol' Perl hackers. We just spend a lot of time on
Perl, and writing about it, and talking about it. The only reason we are Perl
luminaries is that we are Perl luminaries. I'm not necessarily a better
programmer, or have better ideas, or I'm a better debugger than anyone else. I
just do it and make noise about it.

Even though Joey's response was out of line, I admire his spirit of "I'm just
going to go do it." TMTOWTDI is one of the cardinal rules of Perl. Similarly,
over on the module-authors list, the perennial argument of "Maybe CPAN should
have minimum requirements for posting modules" has raised its ugly head.
Instead, I said what I always say during these arguments: "CPAN thrives
BECAUSE of the unfettered uploading of shit, not in spite of it."

So to it will be with Joey's website. Maybe it will be a dismal failure. Maybe
it will become the Next Great Perl resource. However, I know that there is
zero chance of Next Great Perl resource if he doesn't try. The only way you
get home runs is by stepping up to the plate, and if you strike out, you're
doing pretty good. Batting 3/10 is a great batting average, but in real life
we find those odds terrifying.

Personally, as much as I like the community around Perlmonks, I think it's a
terrible site for new people, and is practically unsearchable. I'd love to see
something leapfrog Perlmonks and become the Next Great Thing. That's why I
stopped writing to use.perl.org, because I think it's a terrible news source.
Instead, I started perlbuzz.com, and went with that. Yes, it's different, but
that's OK.

Now, however it was initially intended, I think BASIC turned out to be one of
the first major scripting languages, especially the extended version that DEC
put onto its minicomputers called BASIC/PLUS, which happily included recursive
functions with arguments. I started out as a BASIC programmer. Some people
would say that I'm permanently damaged. Some people are undoubtedly right.

But I'm not going to apologize for that. All language designers have their
occasional idiosyncrasies. I'm just better at it than most. :-)

Anyway, when I was a RSTS programmer on a PDP-11, I certainly treated BASIC as
a scripting language, at least in terms of rapid prototyping and process
control. I'm sure it warped my brain forever. Perl's statement modifiers are
straight out of BASIC/PLUS. It even had some cute sigils on the ends of its
variables to distinguish string and integer from floating point.

But you could do extreme programming. In fact, I had a college buddy I did
pair programming with. We took a compiler writing class together and studied
all that fancy stuff from the dragon book. Then of course the professor
announced we would be implementing our own language, called PL/0. After
thinking about it a while, we announced that we were going to do our project
in BASIC. The professor looked at us like were insane. Nobody else in the
class was using BASIC. And you know what? Nobody else in the class finished
their compiler either. We not only finished but added I/O extensions, and
called it PL 0.5. That's rapid prototyping.

My first scripting language was written in BASIC. For my job in the computer
center I wrote a language that I called JAM, short for Jury-rigged All-purpose
Meta-language. Story of my life…

JAM was an inside-out text-processing language much like PHP, except that HTML
hadn't been invented yet. We mostly used it as a fancy macro processor for
BASIC. Unlike PHP, it did not have 3,000 functions in one namespace. We
wouldn't have had the memory, for one thing.

For good or ill, when I went off to grad school, I studied linguistics, so the
only computer language I used there was LISP. It was my own personal McCarthy
era.

Is LISP a candidate for a scripting language? While you can certainly write
things rapidly in it, I cannot in good conscience call LISP a scripting
language. By policy, LISP has never really catered to mere mortals.

And, of course, mere mortals have never really forgiven LISP for not catering
to them.

That's not helpful. When a project doesn't release a new version, some people
say "Oh, don't use it! They don't release new versions!" When a project does
release a new version, some people say "Oh, don't use it! It's not perfect
yet!"

Meanwhile, the so-called reliable state of the art is a jumble of Perl which
writes cross platform shell scripts to install Perl code, and you customize
that by writing a superclass from which platform-specific modules inherit
pseudo-methods which use regular expressions to search and replace
cross-platform cross-shell code, with all of the cross-platform and
cross-shell quoting issues that entails. I wish I were making any of this up.
(I wrote tests for part of it.)

This is why we can't have nice things.

I did all I could to stop it, but it just wasn't possible. pgTAP 0.20 has
somehow made its way from my Subversion server and infiltrated the PostgreSQL
community. Can nothing be done to stop this menace? Its use leads to cleaner,
more stable, and more-safely refctored code. This insanity must be stopped!
Please review the following list of its added vileness since 0.19 to determine
how you can stop the terrible, terrible influence on your PostgreSQL
unit-testing practices that is pgTAP: …

Don't make the same mistake I did, where I wrote a lot of pgTAP tests for a
client, and now testing database upgrades from 8.2 to 8.3 is just too
reliable! And by all means, DO NOT read the documentation or download and
install this monstrosity, since it could easily lead to cleaner, more stable
code, and therefore losing your job!

I must dispute your view in the strongest terms possible. Internet Explorer is
perfectly safe for everyday use. However, as there is no such thing as perfect
security, you must take additional precautions to keep evil hackers away from
your data. Apply these rules according to the sensitivity of your data, from
least important to most:

* Disconnect your computer from your local network. Download files on another
computer, scan them for viruses, print them out, scan them into your Windows
PC using OCR software, and then view the pages in IE.

* Do the above, but have a priest onsite to bless each page individually
before scanning it. This is an excellent deterrent against viruses with the
word "demon" in the name.

* Do the above, but encase your PC in acrylic and immerse it in a 10,000
gallon tank of holy water. Interact with it while wearing scuba gear.

* Do the above, but put a lid on the tank and immerse it in the ocean.
Interact with your PC via a submersible robot in the tank from from outside
while wearing scuba gear.

If you fail to follow these simple security guidelines, you can't blame
Microsoft for the results.

The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to
structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony
in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and
rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of
structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes
structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into
the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of
hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the
rearticulation of power.

Jonathan Schwartz’s resignation via Twitter reminded me of a strange facet of
Sun company culture: I’ve never known so many married couples working for the
same company. Some of them even worked on the same project together. For the
same boss. From home.

Now, the exact percentage of married couples in a company can’t be used to
compare companies directly – after all, it depends heavily on things like
industry, age, and local marriage laws – but it seems linked to another facet
of Sun company culture: Complete, almost embarrassing disconnect from public
opinion.

The post-Google standard company perks – free food, on-site exercise classes,
company shuttles – make it trivial to speak only to fellow employees in daily
life. If you spend all day with your co-workers, socialize only with your
co-workers, and then come home and eat dinner with – you guessed it – your
co-worker, you might go several years without hearing the words, “*Run Solaris
on my desktop? Are you f—ing kidding me?*“

Schwartz’s “the financial crisis did it” explanation for Sun’s demise is a
symptom of an inbred company culture in which employees at all levels
voluntarily isolated themselves from the larger Silicon Valley culture. Tech
journalists write incessantly about the exchange of expertise and best
practice between companies as a major driver of the Bay area’s success. But
you have to actually talk to your competition to do that – over a beer, or
maybe a pillow.

Or think about shell programming, and reductionism. How many times have we
heard the mantra that a program should do one thing and do it well?

Well…Perl does one thing, and does it well. What it does well is to integrate
all its features into one language. More importantly, it does this without
making them all look like each other. Ducts shouldn't look like girders, and
girders shouldn't look like ducts. Neither of those should look like water
pipes, and it's really important that water pipes not look like sewer pipes.
Or smell like sewer pipes. Modernism says that we should make all these things
look the same (and preferably invisible). Postmodernism says it's okay for
them to stick out, and to look different, because a duct ought to look like a
duct, and a sewer pipe ought to look like a sewer pipe, and hammer ought to
look like a hammer, and a telephone ought to look like either a telephone, or
a Star Trek communicator. Things that are different should look different.

I keep hearing and reading this nice proverb *if it ain't broke, don't fix
it*. The latest apperance was in response to [Shlomi
Fish](http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/37969.html) suggesting
that some Ancient Perl code should be replaced by Modern Perl code.

I am not saying that every pices of code should be rewritten every 6 months,
but in my understanding that sentence actually translates to *let's wait till
it breaks and then panic*.

I think people who say that sentence are afraid that the new version will
break something. Sure, there is always a chance that a change introduces an
error, but, if we are afraid to touch the code, what will happen when later on
we encounter a case where it does not work? For example, if we need to use it
in a new environment. Will we have the courage to change the code then? How
much will it cost in money, time, and lost sleep?

I think we have been trying to teach ourselves that we should have really good
test coverage of our code and then we can easily refactor it and get rid of
technical debt. So why do we keep hearing that sentence?

Popular pet names Rover, Cheryl and Kate could be a thing of the past. Banks
are now advising parents to think carefully before naming their child’s first
pet. For security reasons, the chosen name should have at least eight
characters, a capital letter and a digit. It should not be the same as the
name of any previous pet, and must never be written down, especially on a
collar as that is the first place anyone would look. Ideally, children should
consider changing the name of their pet every 12 weeks.

Expectant mothers have also been advised to choose carefully where they give
birth. Anywhere that has a place name is best avoided. These are listed on
maps, which are freely available on the Internet.

It’s a good idea too, security experts have warned, for children not to get
friendly with certain teachers. For instance, Miss Smith may be enriching your
son’s education but he should try and see if he can’t make a favourite of
Father O’Grinnighan-Scythe II, even though it may mean a lot of staying late.

There are a ton of reasons why Debian may have an older version of an upstream
release. For example, and I hasten to point out that the following list is by
no means exhaustive, and not all of the possibilities are common:

* The Debian package maintainer is dead, but nobody noticed it yet, and nobody
has wanted an update badly enough to do an NMU or to adopt the package.

* The upstream release is actually a fake. It's a trojan, which was put there
by the NSA in order to infiltrate the CIA mainframe. The Debian package
maintainer noticed this and uploaded that version of the package to non-free
instead of main, since the trojan code does not come with proper source.

* Upstream has moved the RSS feed for new releases without notifying the old
feed of the move, so the Debian package maintainer missed that, and doesn't
actually know about the new release. Due to a complicated series of
happenstance involving rainbows, midget unicorns, and the ongoing rewrite of
the Netsurf web browser, the Debian package maintainer is not able to find the
new feed because it would require doing a web search and their browser doesn't
have working form support now. No other browser is available on the Amiga
they're using as their only computer, either.

* The new release is requested by insistent Hurd porters, and the Debian
package maintainer absolutely loathes the Hurd, and will refuse to upload any
packages that work on the Hurd.

* The Debian package maintainer suffers from mental problems cause by reading
debian-devel too much, and now has a nervous breakdown every time they
recognize a name as someone whom they've seen on the list.

* The Debian development process is being sabotaged by Microsoft sending
people to the developers' houses pretending to be TV license checkers or
Jehova's witnesses every time they detect, using the hardware wireless
keylogger embedded in every PC, that the developer is trying to run any Debian
packaging command.

* Apple is also sabotaging Debian by paying me to write snarky e-mails on
Debian mailing lists to distract everyone from working on the actual release,
so that we can get past the freeze and start uploading things again without
having to worry that it breaks things in ways that makes the freeze longer.

Shin Bet being the Israeli internal security agency). A week passes, and then
two, and then three.

An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier
and says, “Ah, you’re an engineer. You are in the wrong place.”

So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the
engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts
designing and building improvements. After a while, they’ve got air
conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty
popular guy.

One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, “So, how’s
it going down there in hell?”

Satan replies, “Hey, things are going great. We’ve got air conditioning and
flush toilets and escalators, and there’s no telling what this engineer is
going to come up with next.”

God replies, “What? You’ve got an engineer? That’s a mistake. He should never
have gotten down there; send him up here.”

Satan says, “No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I’m keeping
him.”

God says, “Send him back up here or I’ll sue.”

Satan laughs uproariously and answers, “Yeah, right. And just where are you

There was a Rabbi living in Louisiana - he was great in the Torah, very
friendly, extremely helpful and righteous - helps the poor, finds jobs for
people, resolves feuds - everybody liked him. And he lived in a remote shack
on the Louisiana coast, right before Hurricane Katrina came.

So two people arrived there in a Jeep and told the Rabbi: “Rabbi, there will
be a flood, come with us so you’ll be saved.” and the Rabbi said: “No, that’s
OK - God will save me.”.

And indeed it started to rain, and there was a lot of water, and so a boat
arrived at the Rabbi’s house and the people there told the Rabbi: “Rabbi,
there’s a flood, come with us and you’ll be saved.” and the Rabbi told them:
“No, that’s OK - God will save me.” and he remained there.

And it continued to rain, and the water level went up and the Rabbi had to
climb to the roof of his shack. A helicopter arrived at his shack, and the
people inside told the Rabbi: “Rabbi, there’s a big flood. Come with us to
safety.”, and the Rabbi said: “No, that’s OK - God will save me.”. And the
Helicopter left.

The water levels rose even more, and the Rabbi drowned, and his soul went to
heaven. There he confronted God and asked him: “Dear God all mighty, I have
been a righteous and good man my whole life - why didn't you save me?”, and
God replied “Well, I tried. I sent you a Jeep, a boat - even a helicopter -
but you wouldn't accept any of them. What more could I have done?”

Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, “Where did
you get such a great bike?” The second engineer replied, “Well, I was walking
along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this
bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said,
"Take what you want." The second engineer nodded approvingly, and said: “Good
choice; the clothes probably wouldn’t have fit.”

In Jerusalem, an American female journalist heard about an old Rabbi who
visited the Kotel, the Western Wall to pray twice a day every day for over
five decades.

In an effort to check out the story, she goes to the holy site and there he
is. She watches the old man at prayer and after about 45 minutes, when he
turns to leave, she approaches him for an interview. “I’m Rebecca Smith from
CNN, sir, how long have you been coming to the Wailing Wall and praying?”

“For about 50 years,” he informs her. “That’s amazing! What do you pray for?”
“I pray for peace between the Jews and Arabs. I pray for all the hatred to
stop and I pray for all of our children to grow up in safety and friendship.”

“And how do you feel, sir, after doing this for 50 years?”

“Like I’m talking to a brick wall!”

I find it insanely difficult to read these comments [to my blog posts]. Not
because they’re bad or mistaken, but mainly because I have very thin skin.
There’s a direct correlation between what I read and pain in my gut. Even
unfair and mistaken criticism cuts me in ways that are just silly. If I read a
bad comment before bed, I don’t sleep. If I trip upon one when I’m trying to
write, I can be distracted for hours. I fantasize about creating an alter ego
who responds on my behalf. But I don’t have the courage for even that
deception. So instead, my weakness manifests itself through the practice
(extraordinarily unfair to the comment writer) of sometimes not reading what
others have said.

So then why do I blog all? Well, much of the time, I have no idea why I do it.
But when I do, it has something to do with an ethic I believe that we all
should live by. I first learned it from a judge I clerked for, Judge Richard
Posner. Posner is without a doubt the most significant legal academic and
federal judge of our time, and perhaps of the last hundred years. He was also
the perfect judge to clerk for. Unlike the vast majority of appeals court
judges, Posner writes his own opinions. The job of the clerk was simply to
argue. He would give us a draft opinion, and we’d write a long memo in
critique. He’d use that to redraft the opinion.

I gave Posner comments on much more than his opinions. In particular, soon
after I began teaching he sent me a draft of a book, which would eventually
become Sex and Reason. Much of the book was brilliant. But there was one part
I thought ridiculous. And in a series of faxes (I was teaching in Budapest,
and this was long before e-mail was generally available), I sent him
increasingly outrageous comments, arguing about this section of the book.

The morning after I sent one such missive, I reread it, and was shocked by its
abusive tone. I wrote a sheepish follow-up, apologizing, and saying that of
course, I had endless respect for Posner, blah, blah, and blah. All that was
true. So too was it true that I thought my comments were unfair. But Posner
responded not by accepting my apology, but by scolding me. And not by scolding
me for my abusive fax, but for my apology. “I’m surrounded by sycophants,” he
wrote. “The last thing in the world I need is you to filter your comments by
reference to my feelings.”

I was astonished by the rebuke. But from that moment on, I divided the world
into those who would follow (or even recommend) Posner’s practice, and those
who wouldn’t. And however attractive the anti-Posner pose was, I wanted to
believe I could follow his ethic: Never allow, or encourage, the sycophants.
Reward the critics. Not because I’d ever become a judge, or a public figure as
important as Posner. But because in following his example, I would avoid the
worst effects of the protected life (as a tenured professor) that I would
lead.

I was lucky as Ricardo SIGNES was also awake who explained that actually he
has stopped using Module::Starter as he is writing
[Dist::Zilla](http://metacpan.org/release/Dist-Zilla) that provides much
better project management capabilities. I pointed him at my blog entry and
after reading it he asked me if I know the expression *yak shaving*. I've
heard it, actually I even read about it in in [The Productive
Programmer](http://productiveprogrammer.com/) I mentioned earlier in [The
Quest for the Perfect
Editor](http://szabgab.com/the-quest-for-the-perfect-editor.html) but I did
not really understand it.

Actually, I think I understood it back when I read the book but promptly
forgotten it as I did not have any way to connect the expression to the
actions or lack of actions.

I was so lucky to find Ricardo there, as he explained:

* I need to fix this bug, but first I better eat something so I don’t get
tired.

* So I'm going to have some cereal, but I'm out of milk.

* So I'll go get some milk. But I heard that yak milk is the best, so I'll go
out to Nepal to find a yak.

* But they're all so hairy, I can't get to their udders.

* So, first I'll just shave the yak.

This is just the way you have to teach. Now I can remember it much more
easily.

Tim Berners-Lee's abandonment of the [Dexter Model for
hypertext](http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~mm/pdf/dexter.pdf) a hypertext model where all
links must be resolvable at all times was (IMHO) the single biggest factor in
creating a successful World Wide Web.

Before the Web, hypertext systems were assumed to have all links resolvable at
all times. This was not a robust design. Now, you would think this would be
more robust than the Web but it fails even for single-file hypertext systems.
Early in my career, I realized that computer systems were not 100% reliable,
so if wanted to create software that failed safe (or at least failed soft),
you had to account for errors at every step of the way. A single-file
hypertext system can still fail if access to the single file is disturbed.
Across the Internet, where all computers on the Internet have not been all up
at the same time since the late 1970's (and possibly not even then), you
cannot build a Dexter Model hypertext system because not all of your links can
be resolved all of the time.

Microsoft's Help system has become much more usable since they went to a Web
(i.e. HTML) based-system. At the risk of being redundant, even if you have a
lint program to verify all hypertext links and destinations, file access
errors will derail your hypertext system when you use a
all-resolvable-all-the-time design (and I don't know if Microsoft had such a
lint tool).

It boils down to handling failures with at least a small amount of grace.
Unix/Linux systems handle errors much better than Microsoft Windows 1.0-3.x
systems because processes can handle out-of-bounds memory errors better
(Windows NT and its descendants fall in-between Unix/Linux and 16-bit
Windows). I once wrote a Perl 4-based server that would run for months at a
time because it could either recover gracefully from an error or stop
gracefully upon an error. The Web runs as well as it does because the software
systems handle link errors with a small amount of grace, rather than just
throwing up their hands or dying horribly. Thank Tim Berners-Lee and his
fellow designers for the reliability of the Web we have today.

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

When I was 18, I had been drumming for about 10 years. (They say that if you
want to be a good drummer, you better have started by your teenage years, or
you'll never make it.)

I got a call from my neighbor. He was about 65 years old.

"Jason," he said, "I made a promise to myself when I turned 60 that I was
going to do 3 things. Lose 60 pounds. Stop smoking. And learn to play a
musical instrument. So far, I've done 2 of those things."

"Which two?" I asked.

"I hear you're a pretty good drummer. Would you like to teach me how to drum?"

(I didn't know what to say. You can't learn drums when you're SIXTY-FIVE! What
do I tell him? Well, maybe it'd be best to let him try it, then he can move on
to guitar or piano or something if he doesn't like it.)

I've never seen anyone that age take a hobby as seriously as this guy took
drumming. A year later, he was pretty proficient, and I cried a little when,
after I left for college, I saw a video of him playing live on stage at a
concert back home.

I learned way more from him than he did from me. I figure now that I should
have been the one paying him for the lesson.

“Let’s free ourselves from the shackles and do something bold!”

I always cringe when I hear this battle cry. Isn’t that sentiment exactly what
set the trajectory for the Perl 6 effort? Maybe it’s just been so long that
people have forgotten.

But that is precisely how Perl 6 became such an amazingly long trek: once you
remove the constraint of staying compatible, everything is suddenly,
potentially, up for reconsideration. Then when you start changing things, you
discover that changes in one part of the language also affect several other,
remote parts of the language. So it starts with the simple desire to fix a
handful of obvious problems in obvious ways… and spirals out as you make
changes, and further still as you make changes in response to your changes,
ever further and further.

At that point, it is exceedingly likely that the project will fizzle out
before it ever comes to any fruition. But even if you have the perseverance,
you face an uphill battle: unless your project has the community’s implicit
blessing as the successor (as Perl 6 does, due to Larry’s presence), it is
likely to simply slip into oblivion… the way Kurila did.

So yes: backcompat is holding us back… the same way that gravity is. It keeps
us from floating away untethered.

Note that I’m not saying it doesn’t really hold us back. I’d love to travel to
space easily, too! I still await Perl 6, as well.

But what I think, every time someone proposes to throw off the shackles of
backcompat and go for it, is that we already have one Perl 6 – we don’t need
another.

At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD
format. PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it
such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is
an abysmal format. Having worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate
for PSD has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion of a
million suns.

If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in
different places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would
think of, and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for
instance, did it suddenly decide that *these* particular chunks should be
aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement should *not* be included in
the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or aligned with
the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included. Either
one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one.
PSD, of course, uses all three, and more.

Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the
attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack
on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the purposes
of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing
fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a file format.

Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format. To
do this, I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have them
consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing them a
copy of some document or other, probably signed in blood. I can only imagine
that they make this process so difficult because they are intensely ashamed of
having created this abomination. I was naturally not gullible enough to go
through with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have printed out
every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were it within my
power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch them on a
spaceship directly into the sun.

PSD is not my favourite file format.

discuss features. If you're writing a compiler then all your clients will be
programmers, so there's no need for such a thing.

>>>

Our clients are the parents, guardians, and teachers of children between the
ages of eight and twelve inclusive.

The intent of Cucumber is to make readable testcases, just as the intent of
COBOL and AppleScript and visual component programming is to enable
non-programmers to create software without having to learn how to program.
